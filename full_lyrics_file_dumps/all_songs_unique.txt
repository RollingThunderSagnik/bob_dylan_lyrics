Woo-hoo!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Lord, I really miss my baby!

She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Dance!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Good God!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!

It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!

Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
Hootenanny television!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Oh, yeah!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
She takes just like a woman - yes!

Yes, come out your window!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
You must think I'm crazy!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
She's insane!
Play fucking loud!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I've got the freight train blues!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!

Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Betty Ross!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!

Alright, now!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Yippee!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
I wanna be yours!
Hope I don't find out too much!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Oh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
I'm in love with you!
They was all over!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
They got away!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!

Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
Oh, no!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Alright!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!

68, but says she's 24, ohh!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Start over!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!

[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
So long, New York!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Well!
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Where you and I will unite."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Tangled up in blue."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
You can't blame us at all."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
I didn't see you around."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Come flowing down so free?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
They look as white as snow."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Get on your horse and ride away."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
We'll both go home together."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
That you must always first forgive them."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
You must know about my debutante."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
We want folksingers here."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
From across that lonesome ocean."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
I would want again tomorrow."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
Will mourn for your return."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
And pretend that you never have met."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
I'll apply them all to thee."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
It's all for the love of thee."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
So write to her tenderly."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
But I know what you want."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"Have you seen dignity?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Country'll grow."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
And punched my cigarette."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
They look as dark as night."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
I can't find my knees."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
And keep him good company."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
I'll bring back my lady."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"Is it easy to forget?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
We'll both go off together."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
You and I'll never know."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
For that reason I will have to stay."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Have it on Highway 61."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
I love far better than thee."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And have it on Highway 61."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Would kill a little bird like me."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
And hung on a willow tree."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
"That way down Highway 61."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
You can't blame me at all."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
God said, "On Highway 61."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Like you never did before,
He's the property of Jesus,
For all intended purposes,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Get born, keep warm,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Like as not, it's better so,
Make you spin or do you in,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
I'm going down the river,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
Is used, it is plain,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Got my mind made up,
I got a bird that whistles,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
You have given me eyes to see,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
People talk over situations,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
It's alright,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
In the little church a-this side of town,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
It was from her ship sailing,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
May be living in another country under another name,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
I won't have my nature way,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
If your time to you is worth saving,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
My hands can't feel to grip,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
You were striped, you were plain,
I want you so bad,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
The train leaves at half past ten,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
All the silver, all the gold,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
So unknown,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
See you fly or watch you die,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Pressing on,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
The sky too is folding under you,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Yes, and I'll go last,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
More people kept a-piling on,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Baby, please stop crying,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
May be the head of some big TV network,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
While riding on a train going west,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Well, well, well,
Silvio, I gotta go,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Adios, mi corazon,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Need a woman all the time,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
You even make love just like a woman,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
I been riding the midnight train,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Said I'm pressing on,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
God knows there's a heaven,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
To be without a home,
Don't let her know that you love her,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
From their fates try to resign,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Someone to close his hear,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
It hurts me, too,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Now you don't talk so loud,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
You wanna drown love,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Father of black, father of white,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
And you make love just like a woman,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
I think we better talk this over,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Oh, in somebody's room,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Don't put yourself over the line,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
That lover, who just walked out your door,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Three angels up above the street,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
People going down to the ground,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
True love of mine,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
And I got the worried blues,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Each time we meet, love,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
That the laws are with him,
Since you've been gone,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Staying far behind without you,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Ain't no going back,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
And joined the John Birch Society,
I want you,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Tell me that you love me only,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Loyalty, unity,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
The kingdoms of experience,
Made of silver or of golden,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Honey, just for you to climb,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Keep a clean nose,
Who's never weak but always strong,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
That they do not respect in any degree,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Three by three they're turning the key,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I got those worried blues,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
For the wise men and the fools,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
The night would see me wide awake,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
I love you, pretty baby,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Nothing too very scientific,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
God knows when,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Go melt back in the night,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Stone you just like they said they would,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
She said she would always stay,
My limbs are shaking,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
It could even be like a myth,
But evidently she don't,
And it's like I ain't here,
Spent my money on you, honey,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
For her to arrive,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
The light I never knowed,
Well, I'm pressing on,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
All the tired horses in the sun,
High water rising, rising night and day,
You've got to serve somebody,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Serve somebody,
Forever young, forever young,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Father who build the mountain so high,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
God knows it's true,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Going,
The Second World War came to an end,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
My senses have been stripped,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
They say that every man must fall,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
"Not me," said his manager,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
She leave by the other and roam,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
The phone's tapped anyway,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
By the night and been to some place new,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Heart of mine,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Looking for a new fool,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Some things are too hot to touch,
A thousand miles from home,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
To be alone with you,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Oxford Town around the bend,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
You better duck down the alleyway,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
God knows there's a river,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Well, get sick, get well,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Don't let me change my heart,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Holding his club like he was a king,
With his fist in a clinch,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
God don't call it treason,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
It's like I ain't here,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Oh, see what you can do,
Tell me,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
As human gods aim for their mark,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
When there is no more,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
God knows it's fragile,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
They say every distance is not near,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Where mercy walks the plank,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
You will be alright, girl,
Give you my money, honey,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
The only son of God Almighty,
All I really wanna do,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Father of loneliness and pain,
And also by his feet,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
In the turning of twilight,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Keep me where you are,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Circled by the circus sands,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
You stole her love from me one day,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Father of day, father of night,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
If you throw it all away,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I've been saved - well, alright,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Is looking for a new fool,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Just like I did before,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
The night passed away so quickly,
In a pine box for all eternity,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
God knows there's a chance,
Stone you and say good luck,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Don't mind the driving rain,
They must bust in early May,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
And I'm in the shade,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
To hang and to lynch,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Had no one to go my bail,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
Where I will always be renewed,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
People carry roses,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
You had enough of hatred,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
I'm going out of my mind,
Carved next to his name,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
The night blows cold and rainy,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Seven days,
I never can go because, you know,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
We'll go someplace unknown,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I got no place left to turn,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
There she come, now, down my way,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Come all without, come all within,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
And ye shall be a-changed,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
They lowered him down as a king,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
True love, they've been without it,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
But you were gambling for support,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
I'm going back to Colorado,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
They don't believe in mercy,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
And to come each time you call,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
A hand set the spark,
Want you,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Who could they get to carry you,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Trouble,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
If she ain't feeling well,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
I would not feel so all alone,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
I fell down to my bended knees,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
I should have left this town this morning,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Never needed to call you my whore,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
He's not selling any alibis,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
One by one they follow the sun,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
A question in your nerves is lit,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
And there's two white horses following me,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Drifting too far from shore,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Someone who will die for you and more,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
But something has changed,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Don't follow leaders,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
But I've been hanging on,
The man in the trench-coat,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
You got something better,
By users, cheaters,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Don't wanna be a bum,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
I can change, I swear,
Far away and over the wall,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Without a dream in my heart,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Like some mystery,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Equality, liberty,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
To know how much I really care,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
But it would not be new,
One more night the stars are in sight,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I run right home and I went to bed,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
God knows how to make it flow,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Better jump down the manhole,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Giving back all of what you owe,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
But I'm saved,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
I'd only have to stay,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Father of cold and father of heat,
To keep up his hate,
To hide 'neath a hood,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
That five walls cannot hide him,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
I ain't looking to block you up,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
God don't call it wrong,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Stand up straight and tall,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I been good while I been waiting,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Aim well, my little one,
But ye shall be a-changed,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
To stay closer than any friend,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Yes, I want you so bad,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
But, if I will save you the time,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
The day would surely have to break,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Fare thee well but for a while,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
And forget my pride,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
I can make it through,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
But the bottles are done,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
But you're doing it again,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
You better chew gum,
Beyond here lies nothing,
And I--I walk out on my own,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Don't let her see that you need her,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
But the time ain't tall,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
How he died nobody could say,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
That long, black train is pulling down,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
By rivers of blindness,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Stay away from the train line,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
In the great unknown,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Grandpa died last week,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
When the night comes falling,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I'm pledging my time to you,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Watered-down love,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
With a killer's pride, security,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Over the hills and far away,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
"Come along and take a trip,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
And played the fife lowly,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
I just don't see why I should even care,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Two by two they step in the dark,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
One by one they followed the sun,
Thank You, Lord,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
The sky too is folding over you,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
For his age he is wise,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
You got to serve somebody,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
May be an actor in a plot,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Private reasons, great or small,
People are crazy, times are strange,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
"Not I," said the referee,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
It's really something,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
I just don't know what to do,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
We take great delight in our own company,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
But, if I can save you any time,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Day you quit me, baby,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Well, I can't understand,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Tell her not to worry,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
I've been around this whole country,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
You married young just like your ma,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
There's always someone who understands,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
And I'm so glad,
All you can do is do what you must,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Look who's back in town,
And rivers that ran through every day,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
When you think that you've lost everything,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
I don't care if you feel like me,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
A man named Martin Luther King,
She's opened up a happy home,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Wintertime in New York town,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Every head is so dignified,
Ooh, watered-down love,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
If not for you,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
The country doctor rambles,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Thieving in the alley,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
You don't have to feed me,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
And it ain't me, babe,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
They say everything can be replaced,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Gonna serve somebody,
Get jailed, jump bail,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
You can run down to the desert,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
It always means so much,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
You need something to open up a new door,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Heart of mine, be still,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Don't ever try to change me,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
At the close of the day,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I like the way that you move your hips,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Eh, see what you can do,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Every nerve is analyzed,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Puffing on a big cigar,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Four by four, no illusion for,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Mixing up the medicine,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
You need something to open your eyes,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Or select you or dissect you,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
You made it there somehow,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
If you'd see me this way,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I get my sweet reward,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Ever since I been a child,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
That fellow who never blushes,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
A foreign sound to your ear,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I just say no thanks,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
And I'm back in the rain,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Want you so bad,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Laying low,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
If I didn't have to guess,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Saved,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
The path you've endured has been rough,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
To be out on your own,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
I been good,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Of this I can't say very much,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
I can't be good, baby,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
They say every man must need protection,
Nothing was delivered,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Searching everywhere I know,
It still ain't me, babe,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Strangers all give me the news,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
In the foggy web of destiny,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
You can raise up your right hand,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
You were snow, you were rain,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Look away, you rolling river,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I've been all around the world, boys,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
So I got those worries blues,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I got two white horses following me,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
You have given all there is to give,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Far away from it all,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
A dream about you, baby,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
I thank the Lord,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
So, never leave me lonely,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
It was you who came right through,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Memory, ecstasy,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
But, deep inside my heart,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Go down to the river, babe,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Winter would have no spring,
She never does me wrong,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
New morning,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
They say every man needs protection,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Watch the river flow,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
And pretend that we never have touched,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
And may you stay forever young,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
And the point is slick,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
I can finish this alone, honey,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
On the stone that remains,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Take the motherless children off the street,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Every brain is civilized,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Don't matter what you did,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
And, on their promises of paradise,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
But now morning is clear,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
They walk among the stately trees,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Too serious to fool,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
And she makes love just like a woman,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Far past the frozen leaves,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Where the neon madmen climb,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I went down to scrub and rub,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Like a dog on a chain,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
To be one your own,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
No direction home,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
You're beautiful to me,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
In his anger and his shame,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
The country music station plays soft,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Bring the wife and family,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Speaking to some French girl,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Don't tie no bows,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Maybe when we both get sober,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Under the microscope,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Trust yourself,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
And, if anybody asks me,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
She would have married me,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Oh, watered-down love,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Yesterday is just a memory,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
My arms and legs were broken,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Father of air and father of trees,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Well, come all without, come all within,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
I can't understand,
And, if I can save you any time,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
My dear, sweet friend,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
The beat is pumping,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
If anything is gonna sell,
You came down on me like white thunder,
Like a rolling stone,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
China doll, alcohol,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
I got the worried blues,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
The wind howls like a hammer,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
Well, I'm so glad,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Poor boy never say die,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Never weak but always strong,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
We've killed each one,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Relationships of ownership,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
You always responded when I needed your help,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
And think they're fooling you,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
May you stay forever young,
But I know that he don't talk,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
To find out if she's talked,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
He won't do nothing to you,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
In another I witnessed a crime,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Don't let her see,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
But I will be back, I will survive,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
I want my arms around you,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
I just keep pressing on,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Going, going, gone,
Why she did go,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
With no direction home,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Front door shut, back door too,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Don't let her know,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Got me a secret membership card,
And you know I could never be your own,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Beating for the dead that rise,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
You find God in the church of your choice,
That you'd have liked me to,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Out to the windy beach,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Icicles hanging down,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Advertising signs, they con,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
If you must cling to someone,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
I don't want to meet your kin,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Love that's pure no accident,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
I threw it all away,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
You'll change your last name, too,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
And here I sit so patiently,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
And furnish me with tape,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
A true love of mine,
It always has hit me from below,
The haunted, frightened trees,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Newspapermen eating candy,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
When all will be well,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Going, going,
Up and down the block,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I got a wife and five little children,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
She said she would never forget,
All them prophets good and gone,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
God knows it's outta sight,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I have no one to meet,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
You could look at it and weep,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
No, nothing was delivered,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Using every angle under the sun,
By losers, cheaters,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Someone to open each and every door,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
That fired the gun,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
You want watered-down love,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Oh, Angelina,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Try to be a success,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
I once held her in my arms,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
I don't care if you analyze me,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Don't wear sandals,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Went back home to the yard,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
The day you quit me, baby,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Well, I may just swear,
In the darkness of my night,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
To a solid rock,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
This place ain't doing me any good,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
She'll be coming forth,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
And, if I see the day,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
I bless the day I found you,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Read books and repeat quotations,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
He is centuries old,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
You have explained every mystery,
To protect his white skin,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
For something that he never done,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
She's the worst you could ever have,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Light yourself a candle,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
My woman needs it every day,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Hang around the ink-well,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Badge out, laid off,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Joey, Joey,
Thinking about the government,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Without your sweet love,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
And I don't want to drag you down,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
I'll be on my way,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
I'm never, never far from home,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Oh, singing just for you,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Dream about you, baby,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
But it ain't me, babe,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Precious father, loving mother,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
God knows it's terrifying,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Can't find what I need,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Just don't know what to do,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
I could have left this town by noon,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
And I'm just like that bird,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
For she ain't the same,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Madams light the candles,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
The air is getting hotter,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
It don't matter what you did,
I know I can't win,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Judge and jury took their stand,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
And, although that we're single and free,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
You can hear them tires squeal,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Never did feel this way before,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
So glad,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
We live in a political world,
Well, I gave you all my money,
They run a brick and tile company,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Corrina, Corrina,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Without a love of my own,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
And the whole world is on your case,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
Of ancient history,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Everything's a-hers or his,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Father of night, father of day,
She'll surely turn to white,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
I went into the city, into the town,
They pass by so silently,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
But you try with your whole soul,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Going home,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
I had so much left to do,
With the juice running down my leg,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
You got something I want plenty of,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Over your senses you have no control,
A man with a badge skips by,
One by one until there were none,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Something about you that I can't shake,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Each one playing a horn,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Into my own parade,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
With what your fate is going to be,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
The winter would hold no spring,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Try hard, get barred,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
I shall be released,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And give him back the time he's done,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Rabbit running down across the road,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
How he died nobody can say,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
You have given everything to me,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Don't know what to do without it,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Ye shall be changed,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Already the fiesta has begun,
And she'll be coming forth,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
My woman's never sitting at home,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
To have--be on your own,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
To your tambourine in time,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
That one doctor cannot save him,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Like a complete unknown,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
In the hills of mystery,
My love, she speaks softly,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I wish tonight were here,
You don't want a love that's pure,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Just like a rolling stone,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Broken hands on broken plows,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Just to know that you are near,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
When I seen him lose control,
Looking 'bout the government,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
God knows you've got to weep,
If you'd see me this a-way,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Friends with you,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
But I'm pressing on,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
And comes to a permanent stop,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
To shine in through,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
As the present now will later be past,
Just then the order came to charge,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
This world is ruled by violence,
I march in the parade of liberty,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Human gods aim for their mark,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The one we can see and can feel,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Don't let her hear,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
You and me, we had completeness,
While paupers change possessions,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
She once was a true love of mine,
For the politician's gain,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
I rambled out of New York town,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
As his youth now unfolds,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
First to come in was the flying moth,
That must be what it's all about,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
I got my mind made up,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Living in the land of Nod,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
A handle hid out in the dark,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Look out, kid,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
God knows it's a crime,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Cares not to come up any higher,
To be on your own,
Father of time and father of dreams,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
You gotta look some other place,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Is it really any wonder,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
If ever I prove false to you,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Get back, write Braille,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Now, won't you tell me true,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
You have given me life to live,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Not the end, not the end,
First degree and second degree,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Precious angel under the sun,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Resent him to the bone,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
The joint is jumping,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
God knows it's a struggle,
And not going through any great extreme,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
You say my kisses are not like his,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
It's a price I have to pay,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
All that and more and then some,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
A complete unknown,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
And you take just like a woman,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Mercury, gravity,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Just as long as you stay with me,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
In love and with kindness,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
This situation can only get rougher,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Or have done something wrong,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
And to come every time you call,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
And your streets are getting empty,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
Automobile coming into style,
But he can't be blamed,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I can see the turning of the key,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
A worried man with a worried mind,
I don't wanna fake you out,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Face full of black soot,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
So many roads, so much at stake,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
To gather flowers constantly,
Far away in the stormy night,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
I went into the city, went into the town,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Who will promise never to part,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
God knows everything,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
And on the highway of regret,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
The angels play on their horns all day,
They tell me every man must fall,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
God sees it all unfold,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
They say every man must fall,
And I got those worried blues,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Vanished from my hand,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
They say every man need protection,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Where life and death are memorized,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
See her in that very tight skirt,
It's rising up above my head,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
On this new morning, new morning,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
It's too bad he had to go,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
A million faces at my feet,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
And, though the line is cut,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Waiting for the trains,
In the instant that I preach,
Stripping away at it all,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
How does it feel,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
That can do what's never been done,
I found my world, found my world in you,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Yes, I'm so glad,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
When she lays upon the grass,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
They keep it all hid,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
That her father was going to hang,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Don't you tell Henry,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Honey, I will meet you there,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
In the little church a-this side of tow,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
It all seemed so well-timed,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
I had no one for to go my bail,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
In the lonely night,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
All day long I hear him shouting loud,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Love don't have any place,
He been around the world and back again,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
She got great big hind legs,
The carpet too is moving under you,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Don't try No Doz,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Eh, in somebody's room,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
And gathering storms may arise,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
God knows there's a purpose,
Go away from my window,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Six months on the chain gang,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
He's young and on fire,
Drag you down or drain you down,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
People talk of situations,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Someone to close his heart,
Better jump down a manhole,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Watching the river flow,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
When I was in Missouri,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I'm leaving today,
I'm so glad,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Carry the New York Times,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
I'd already gone the distance,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
But it ain't him to blame,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
My love, she speaks like silence,
We'll fly the night away,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
But, if you want me to,
To be so useless and all,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Searching high, searching low,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
If'n you don't know by now,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
In the end,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
But, to remain as friends,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
And she aches just like a woman,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Baby, let me follow you down,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
I try my best to be like I am,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Don't let me drift too far,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Too noble to neglect,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Eh, singing just for you,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
And point away from the past,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
To strict party-platform ties,
You'll be doing society a favor,
God knows that, when you see it,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
To be--direction home,
Without ideals or violence,
You to me were true,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Don't let yourself fall,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
And come every time you call,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Yet every distance is not near,
In one the surface was frozen,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
I went back home, put on my tie,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
We never much thought we could get very old,
They--they show me to the door,
Simplify you, classify you,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I'd be sad and blue,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I need a shot of love,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
Remember me to one who lives there -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
I'm sure it was not three -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
Private reasons - great or small -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
As suicide remarks are torn -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
That can win what's a-never been won -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
Turn, turn, turn again -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
Disconnect these cables--
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
Havanagee-luh-
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
Hava-na-
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
It can't be this way everywhere -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
Oh, my-
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
Whispering your secret emotion -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
Indians camp along her border -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Ha-va-
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Havana-gee-
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
That's where you belong --
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
Thank--
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
I long to hold you in the night -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
I got no idea what I want -
How badly they were shocked -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
Hang out the whole next day -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
Haven't seen her since that night -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
With notions his canoe was laden -
Leave all the children home -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
You will not hear a laugh -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
Democracy don't rule the world --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
I a-hope you can hear--
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
I hope that you can hear--
Ten thousand miles or more -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
First degree and second degree -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
To know where you are -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
With no other choice except but for to go -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
You may not see me tomorrow.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Well, I'm just thumping.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Take it on down to give me grow.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
I know you always say that you agree.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Mary wore three links of chain.
I'll only let you down.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
And each one I've never seen again.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
What you'll say when you get home.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
To see that you're madly in love.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
My face you'll never see no more.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Everything is broken.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.

Just like the time before and the time before that.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
And I'll rock you too.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
I been worrying about you, baby.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Well, our captain, he is dead - died for a maid.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
You break your promise all over the place.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
And he was a friend of mine.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Valentines can't buy her.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Going through all these things twice.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
I threw it all away.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
You can make it too.

I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.

Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
And pretend that we never have touched.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
And that failure's no success at all.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.

And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

Police at your back.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
Blood on your saddle.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
Leave at your own chosen speed.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.

The hour when the ship comes in.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.

Wiggle till the moon sees you.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.

Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
And shot it fulla holes.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.

Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
You can show me a new place to start.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.

He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
I can't shoot them anymore.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
And the sails are spread.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
There's man who swears he's not to blame.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
When she's better only time'll tell.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
If you throw it all away.
Far down the street we stray.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
But I ain't neither one.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
From my toes up to my ears.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
By that soft and shining sea.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
To which a scoundrel clings.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
With gold and silver in her hand.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Lay your hand upon my head.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
You'll never see me frown.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
I got nothing to go back to now.
The sooner you can leave.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
I always thought that he was well.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
And I want you to be that woman.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Gonna serve somebody.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
I don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
For that's the way I remember her best.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Ever since we've been apart.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Every link was Jesus's name.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
For an instant hand touched hand.
For the times, they-they are a-changing.
And wait for succeeding kings.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
Down to New Orleans.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
And left me here facing the wall.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
You're the only love I've ever known.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
As if a wedding vow.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
My love, she speaks softly.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
I have heard rumors all over town.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
They're making a voyage to the sun.
This kind of love, I-I'm lovesick.
Trouble...
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
By the jealousy of others around her.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
She said she would always stay.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
People bending broken rules.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
Or define you or confine you.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.

All my connections too.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
My love winks, she does not bother.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Is what this thing here is for.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
When I paint my masterpiece.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
People sleeping in broken beds.
You always got more than enough rope.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Or put up against the wall.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Everything inside is made of stone.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
They found him dead in the street one day.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
I just can't keep from crying.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
You know the song in my heart.
In the pale moonlight.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
He gone north for a while.
I had so little time to fail.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
I find it so difficult to leave.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
An innocent man in a living hell.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
Hope you're ready.
That set everybody free.
I've made shoes for everyone - even you - while I still go barefoot.
I got a bird that sings.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
What looks like the easy way out.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
With the glory that is to be.
I stood wondering which way to go.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Come on, darling.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
For the times, they are a-changing.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
But my heart just won't give in.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
And I need you, yeah.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Under the midnight moon.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
The National Guard stands around his door.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
The last radio is playing.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
I got nothing left to burn.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
There was nobody around.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
Baby, two feet from the well.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
For me to return to or chase.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
For as long as love will last.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
I can't see through it anymore.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
It was you who understood.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Come on, baby...
What some people are gonna do for money.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Thanks.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
Standing on your window, honey - yes, I've been here before.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
That I really did try to get close to you.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
The whole night through.
Kisses she gave him three.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Life don't mean a thing.
Went into a laundry to wash my clothes down.
It'll never do, somehow.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
I think this time we should escape.
It always does when you're with me.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
Some place so high above this wall.
Lost time is not found again.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
And you must realize the danger.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
"Don't trill no news on me.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
And come away with me.
Never will want for money.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.

But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
It was all over by a quarter past.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Everything is gonna be fine.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
And she had left him to die in there.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
To hold me in your arms.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
And time is beginning to crawl.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
In the summertime when you were with me.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
I see that stationmaster too.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Baby, baby...
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
And discovered her invisible self.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
His voice was low with pain.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
She saw her father's body broken.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
But with the country to where you're going.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Go lightly on the ground.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Thought I was a communist.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
I'm falling in love with you.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
I'm going where I never been before.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
Hope I don't blow it.
That old ship was a-going down.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away - we're gonna forget it.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I'll remember you.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
The same as my father before him.
A true love of mine.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
She once was a true love of mine.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Who always was too proud to beg.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
Everything is gonna be alright.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Watch the parking meters.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
I need a shot of love.
You'll do as much for me.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
There were six thousand people there.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Can't see over to the other side.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
Gone as the season she's taken.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Where teardrops fall.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
You cast your spell and I went under.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
If it just don't make me hurts.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
And clouds cover up the ground.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
And the pearls are from Japan.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
I'd like to know.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
You're a big girl now.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
I had something to protect.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
"And stay all night with me.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Evidently she won't.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
See that my grave is kept clean.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
And she'll only know he's dead.
The National Guard stands around the door.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Heart of mine.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
He's got his mother's eyes.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
"And light on my right knee.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
Leading me, going home.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Rain would gather, too.
Step lightly on the ground.
And laid his life on the line.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
You'd better get that in your head.
And all I see are dark eyes.
He ain't-a got no name.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
When my working day's through.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
But these to tell what's true.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
If not for you.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Living down Sonora way.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
So long, honey babe.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
She just acts like we never have met.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Mortality, reality.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
Trust yourself.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
To know which way the wind blows.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
In an oil refinery.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Mine alone.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
I'm a poet, I know it.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
High society, notoriety.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
When my memory is not so short.
Reality has always had too many heads.
As the present now will later be past.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
In fond memory appear.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Looking for a new friend.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
That's really and truly an American.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
So quickly into autumn.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
I took some comfort there.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
I'm ready when you are, Senor.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
And it is time for me to slide.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Baby, please come home.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
The night will soon be gone.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Join the army if you fail.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Look a-the other way.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Hmm, tell me.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Dollar a day's worth.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
It don't matter, anyhow.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Even before you came in the door.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Girls like birds fly away.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
It's just the same as talking to you.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
But it was more than I could do.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.

Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Just crying out that he was framed.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
Some speak of the future.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
All because his face was brown.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
You can't win with a losing hand.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
Waiting on my burying ground.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Know not what the years may hold.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Please let me ride you home.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
I just can't do what I done before.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
I'm gonna get my coat - I feel the breath of a storm.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Funny way to start a picnic.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
And no time to think.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Havanageeluh.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Using ideas as my maps.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.

That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
And the people that confronted him were many.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
I just can't see through it anymore.
And your highway's getting filled.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.

I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Honey, baby.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
That brave and devoted band.
When I run outta things to investigate.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Most of the time.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.

No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.

Ten by ten they drank it again.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
I'd be lost if not for you.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.

Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
And the morning will be breaking.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
I been in this thing too long.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.

Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Neighborhood bully.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
You sound like a hillbilly.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
That last night I was with.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Adios, mi corazon.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
New morning.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
In the brightness of my day.
Under the hedges.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Father of love and father of rain.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Memories of what used to be.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
You're too hot, darling.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.

You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Wants to get it paid off.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
The light I never knowed.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
They got him on conspiracy - they were never sure who with.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.

In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
I will only let you down.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
I'm sad and lonely too.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
And try to avoid the scandals.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
When you made everybody pay.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Last radio is playing.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
They would not let me be.
And I've never been too impressed.
They both rode off together.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
I never saw the man again.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
And it never seemed strange.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
And I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
It's that million dollar bash.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Madams light the candles.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Everybody must get stoned.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
You want a watered-down love.
To reach of your rattling drums.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I-I love her just the same.
Magic in a magical land.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
Close your eyes, close the door.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
At the sorority sisters' home.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Baby, baby.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
No kindred or relative nigh.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
And every window made of glass.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
To kill with no pain.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
But I would never do you wrong.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Looking for the places only they would know.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
Oh, yes, they did.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
You are on the bottom.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Suffering like a fool.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Trying to create a next world war.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
And then unto eternity.
For there's a slow--said there's a slow, slow train coming.
Mama, you been on my mind.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.

With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Headed out for the western skies.
And the Santa Fe.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Down along my restless palms.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.

That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.

You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
With the golden loom.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
In the palace of the Pope.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
They seem determined to go all the way.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.

And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
When he played and we didn't dance.

Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Hope that it don't sleet.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Then the mailman comes in - even he's gotta take a side.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
I know the kinds of things you like.
I couldn't find any.

The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
It sure is right on a night like this.

Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.

He screamed a bit and away he flew.
And his mother had to turn her face away.

Blowing like my woman's on board.

Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.

I can walk anytime around the block.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.

About having to scrounge your next meal.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.

I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.

Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Oh, convey herself away.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.

Things I never meant nor wished to say.
Tomorrow will be another day.
The sooner you can go.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Good as I been to you.
Have fallen from her curls.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
And you only got ten.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.

But I ain't got Corrina.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
It runs both cold and deep.

Now and forever let it be me.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.

I was looking around, I was outta sight.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.

All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Throw my ticket in the wind.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
Duality, mortality.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
I don't care what in the world you do.
While evening slips away.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.

"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
You left me standing out in the cold.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
If I ride back again.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
With all these promises you left for me.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Slowly into autumn.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
If you just let me come home with you.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
Bid farewell forever.
They don't make nothing here no more.
That which is not permanent don't last.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
But I was raised on the other.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
But the mountains of the past.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
She's in some foreign land.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
The hour that the ship comes in.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Went into the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
I scarcely feel the glow.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
May you stay forever young.
To make me think I'm wrong.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Just to take somebody's money away.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
I know they're not what they seem.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Yes, tell me.
The next day could be your last.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
That keep us so tightly bound.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
I said that.
You're on the bottom.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
The country doctor rambles.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
What's real and what is not.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
Oh, got my mind made up.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
He's only a pawn in their game.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
But mine was a little different, you see.
That's the way I remember her best.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
But I know that I can't move.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
And relive my dreams.
So the radio didn't work so well.
I did not do it knowingly.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
68, but says he's 24.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Lord, protect my child.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
I don't know.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
But you can't see in and I--it's hard looking out.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
There's no words that need to be said.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yeah, serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
But there's one promise, darling:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
His epitaph plain:
Serve somebody:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Till I come into New York town:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Some speak of the future;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Crumble into one another;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Had to be held down by big police;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
All lies and jest;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
I find complete love;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Make promises by the hour;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
So many things that we never will undo;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
With the drumsticks in his pants?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
How could they let you go?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Don't you remember making baby love?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
And one deserving of affection?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
How could they ever mistake you?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Before it is washed to the sea?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Across the swamp of time?
By golly, what more can I say?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
Can I come home with you?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
How's everything in heaven?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Am I ready?
For all these earthly things?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Before he can see the sky?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Can you get back in?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Oh, where are you tonight?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Where did you lose your wings?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
I seen better times, but who has not?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
So I can know if I'm really real?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Across the swooping plain?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Why and what's the reason for?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Just what in the world has come over you?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Baby, what more can I tell?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
What else can a poor boy do?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
When he's standing in front of you?
Before they're forever banned?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Of everything you see?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Have they missed you?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
What's wrong with you this time?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Why must you always try to make me over?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Does anyone even try?
Before you call him a man?
Poor boy, where you been?
Did you respect me for what I did?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How can I live for You?
What can I do for You?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Why would I want to take your life?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
What?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
And how does it feel?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Like a rolling stone?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
How many more can they afford?
Ready, George?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
How much poison did they inhale?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Are you ready?
Too many people have died?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Has anybody seen my love?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Who killed Davey Moore?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Before he can hear people cry?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
That too many people have died?
What can I give to You?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Gal, where you been so long?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
What would life be?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Who you thought you were talking to?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Where did you hide your halo?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
How many more without any reward?
How many compared to yesterday?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
When did you leave heaven?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Baby, can't you tell?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Just like a rolling stone?
How can you say he will haunt you?
What good am I?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Before they're allowed to be free?
How long are we gonna be riding?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Must everybody bow?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
How does it feel?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
To love and follow His direction?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
So I'll make my stand
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
I live in another world
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
I thought that it was well-understood
And your trouble is you know it too good
I want you, baby, just to understand
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
It's something you did
I run right home and I went to bed
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
To see him obviously framed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
He was a clean-cut kid
And into the path you are hurled
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
You used--be so proud
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
She let go of my hand
We live in a political world
By no special friend
"Equality". I spoke the word
Things would be different the next time we wed
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
I will not go down under the ground
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
While some, on principles baptized
Now, whenever I get up and
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
And then you told me later as I apologized
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Now you don't act so--so proud
And that even the nobles get properly handled
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Maybe someday you will understand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
You used to be so amused
And those whom doom and death had spared
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
But she ain't gonna find the road
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Silvio, silver and gold
And things would be different the next time we wed
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
Standing on the water, casting your bread
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
There ain't nothing in this world
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
But something has changed
I've been walking around
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
They took a clean-cut kid
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
I'll always thank the Lord
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
The changes I was going through can't even be used
But now something has changed
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
How many times can a man turn his head
For what you sold that's not been received
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
All the sweethearts you can hold
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Somebody seen him hanging around
Many times I've often prayed
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
But all that suffering was not to be compared
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Just what you had in mind
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
He wagged his tail and shook his head
As I stand upon the sand
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Now you don't seem so proud
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Now, a very great man once said
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Its iron claws attached
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Nothing was delivered
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
She been gone
And plenty time for good romance
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
But I can get another one
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
"It's only you that he does crave
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
You into thinking you're the one
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
So, I called up the operator of time
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
If dogs run free, then what must be
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Limited in sex they dare
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
A girl who would murder her own, true love
With all memory and fate
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Knows there's no success like failure
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Everybody's wearing a disguise
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
I do declare
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
I been wondering all about me
From all the plans they do pursue
Mona tried to tell me
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Well, six white horses that you did promise
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Why wait any longer for the one you love
But the dark does die
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
But I feel nothing for their game
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
You smiling through the fence at me
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Leaving men wholly, totally free
You said you'd never compromise
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Better stay away from those
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
To give the special one you seek a chance
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
The crashing waves roll over me
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Though its shadow's metal badge
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Says it's closing time
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
You say you're looking for someone
Con you into thinking that you're the one
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
As he rises to fame
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
There were times when I was so lonesome
What about that millionaire
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
She knows there's no success like failure
When I'm all alone
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
That she's the same one
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
So I look like a walking mountain range
Where I could watch her waltz for free
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Remember me to the one who lives there
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
From the start by the rule
How many ears must one man have
But I can't say I sympathize
So I remember every face
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
And I ain't complaining none
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
And you see why it's so unique to be
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Lies that life is black-and-white
When the rain is blowing in your face
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Waiting to find out what price
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Hunger pays a heavy price
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
To show you something you seen before
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
I can survive and I can endure
Should I leave them by your gate
Looking at hands for the lines that were
And I would send a message
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
If dogs run free, why not we
Remember me to one who lives there
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
We see this empty cage now corrode
Among the lovely people living free
I'm ready for to fade
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
You cut to the core
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
He'll see by his grave
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
I rode with him in a taxi once
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
How was I to know you'd be the one
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Up into some paradise
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
You just pick anyone
It'll be with me unto the grave
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
On the rising curve
You're not free to belong to me
Just pick anyone
Should I put them by your gate
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And the Negro's name
Taking care of somebody nice
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Maybe someday you will look back and see
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Little did I realize
At dawn my lover comes to me
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
The cause was there before we came
And suddenly there appeared before me
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
You know, it's not even safe no more
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
If dogs run free, why not me
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
What you're gonna say when you get home
A bed that is never mine
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Most of the time I can't even be sure
She plunged him into well water where
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
What good am I then to others and me
Full of hope and desire
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
It's getting dark, too dark to see
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
They say don't come back no more
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
I am homeless, come and take me
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Well, it's all new to me
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
The man the authorities came to blame
And I'm just the same as anyone else
What's probably got you baffled more
I don't even notice she gone
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
It's all new to me
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And that is that one must always flush out his house
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
So up she picked her babies three
Just what you will say when you get home
When the roses fade
See the primitive wallflower freeze
All I feel is heat and flame
And never sat once at the head of the table
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
While them that defend what they cannot see
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
For your weary toes to be a-touching
If I was with her too long
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And there's no telling who that it's naming
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
What am I saying? What am I knowing
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
The order is rapidly fading
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Beyond here lies nothing
They're drinking up and walking
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
She rode by night and came by morning
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
But then a whistle will be blowing
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
For your weary toes to be touching
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
You left me standing in the doorway crying
The battle outside raging
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
'Cause the battle outside raging
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
The order is a-rapidly fading
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Deceived me into thinking
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
There's nothing in here moving
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Where the time and the tempo drag
It's not a bad way to make a living
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I have fallen far beneath
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
You go north and you go south
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Look out, the saints are coming through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
And how I know I'll make it through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Then she told us how times were tough
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Well, there ain't no going back
Shoot in the back
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Her voice once and talk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
You turn around to take a final peek
But they caught him and they brought him back
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Make everything from toy guns that spark
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
The man in me will do nearly any task
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
I wish she'd unlock
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
And if my love is real
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Ring bar, hard to tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Oh, how does it feel
A-how does it feel
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
All and all can only fall
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
He's sure got a lot of gall
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Ring bell, hard to tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
They ask me how I feel
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Then why don't she tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
He's taught in his school
I chased me a woman up the hill
A girl by the whirlpool
Muttering small talk at the wall
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
How many seas must a white dove sail
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
How does it feel
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
As the last fire-truck from hell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
To make all that should be killed to crawl
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
How many seas must the white dove sail
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
And remain as I am
Two eyes took the aim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
You better not chew gum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But I can hear another drum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
"For you cannot relive them
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Well, I'm hanging on
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
To my knowledge there's just one man
Why did you trade heaven
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
But I swear I see my reflection
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
For the loser now might be later to win
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Out of the shower comes a football man
She said that all the railroad men
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
My love, she's like some raven
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Poor boy in a red-hot town
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
But me, I expected it to happen
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Somebody new to beat on
A-she takes just like a woman
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Nothing we can call our own
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
Darkness at the break of noon
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
"Not me," said the gambling man
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Trying to get a lead on
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
All their daughters put me down
And you ache a-just like a woman
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Suicide remarks are torn
And all their daughters put me down
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And the smell of their roses does not remain
How can the life of such a man
And she aches just like a woman
For the loser now will be later to win
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Have died in battle or in vain
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Must meet the dawn
He got that fortress on the mountain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
In ceremonies of the horsemen
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Yes, and someone must explain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
She got such a sweet disposition
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Guns and clubs followed him down
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
To remember the times when I was your only man
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
In the pigpen
You don't need a weatherman
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Their religion of the little ten women
The next morning she had awoken
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
She takes just like a woman
The ones that jump on the wagon
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
That long, black train is pulling down
You take just like a woman
But it's hard to think on
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
How many roads must a man walk down
Will not be understood as they're spoken
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
That long, black train is pulling on down
And she wakes just like a woman
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
Well, you fake just like a woman
From heights that they could not gain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Yet I swear I see my reflection
But the post office has been stolen
But all their daughters put me down
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I figure maybe we're even
You need something to make it known
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Advertising signs that con
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
And there's no exit in any direction
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
I'll be waiting at the station
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
And the corner sign
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
There's nothing you can say or do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Every place I wanna go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
All I'd like you to do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
All I really wanna do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Silvio, I gotta go
Aladdin and his lamp
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
How many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
What good am I while you softly weep
The man in the coon-skin cap
Man in the coon-skin cap
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Never no more do I wonder
The face of God will appear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
My ship is in the harbor
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
All you boys better run for cover
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
She took him by his long, yellow hair
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Still I've always kind of missed her
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I close my eyes and I wonder
And I don't even think about her
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I don't have to go far
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
For I am married to a house carpenter
I could feel a whole lot better
You heard me saying a prayer for
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Alone you stand with nobody near
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
So, don't fear if you hear
Still I say her love-words over
In one I was running and in another
I say, "Why you say that for
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
At any moment you could go under
The lover who has just walked out your door
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Who came here from Cuba's door
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
When you whispered in my ear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
For all eternity I think I will remember
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
But morning is clear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
When only you are near
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The wind howls like a hammer
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Seven days
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
People on the platforms
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
To the cutting of fences
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
You can fall down on your knees
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
You never turned around to see the frowns
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And the poor white remains
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
With a fantastic collection of stamps
You should be made to wear earphones
We living in times when men commit crimes
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
True love can make a blade of grass
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Romantic facts of musketeers
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Thinking of a series of dreams
At times I think there are no words
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
With a big bouquet of the roses
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
"Not me," said the man whose fists
They whisper in the wings
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Now, you must provide some answers
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
But still remains
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Her window's wide open, African trees
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
People carry roses
Don't wear sandals
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
On the back of the fish truck that loads
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Statues made of matchsticks
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
He's not selling any alibis
The cowboy angel rides
Glide across the lonely years
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
I try to tell it like it is
Well, the ragman draws circles
Don't follow leaders
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
You been hurt so many times
And your father, to your sister he explains
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
To sharpen the senses
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
And the princess and the prince discuss
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
I was thinking of a series of dreams
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Wants eleven dollar bills
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
And then complains
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
And so Patty calls the cops
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
In the dimestores and bus-stations
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
What good am I if I say foolish things
That it's you and no one else that owns
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
And I try to harmonize with songs
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
I let it slip gladly to my friends
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
When your mother sends back all your invitations
As friends and other strangers
And, though the masters make the rules
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And tells me of her dreams
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I'm gonna let you pass
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
How many deaths will it take till he knows
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Mama, you know, awaits the news
You know that he has no intentions
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Six-time users
And without further notice asks you how it feels
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Good and bad, I define these terms
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Girl by the whirlpool's
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
To memorizing politics
Six-time losers
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
I'd gladly confess
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
But, though the masters make the rules
The empty-handed painter from your streets
To hold each other tight
Ain't it hard when you discover that
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Plants in the bed, but
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
There's some people that
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
He really wasn't where it's at
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Wait for the morning light
We can hold up a toast if we meet
And I, in my armor, turning about
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
They tell me to be discreet
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I'm on the pavement
Johnny's in the basement
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Like a corkscrew to my heart
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Every new messenger bringing evil report
In the precious winds they rot
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
So he never thinks straight
But, if the arrow is straight
You are there in the flickering light
The slow one now will later be fast
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
How many years can a mountain exist
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
With your pockets well protected at last
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Talking that the heat put
He built a fire on Main Street
To keep it in your mind and not forget
One more night I will wait for the light
I think that it's best
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
I got into the driver's seat
And, since my feet are now fast
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
You don't forget
How many years can some people exist
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
They tell me revenge is sweet
You're gonna get hit
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
You're hearing my heart beat
One more night the moon is shining bright
In the stillness of the midnight
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
That might be all that you got
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Everyone still talks about
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Without any doubt
I soon get some rest
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Keep me set apart
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And the first one now will later be last
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Keep it in your mind and not forget
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
By the way, that's a cute hat
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
But, then again, there's only one I've met
She seems too far out
I'm moving after midnight
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
The slowest now will later be fast
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Well, I finally started thinking straight
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
It don't take too long to find out
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You used to laugh about
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
You used to laugh-make fun about
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Everything is always right
I'll remember you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
And I tell this truth to you
I just might have to come see you
It's just crazy being here with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To protect you and defend you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
I can be just like you
To be alone with you
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He been living there three years now
But sooner or later one of us must know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Down every street there's a window
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Don't it always a-go to show
Don't it always go to show
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
I'd sure like to know
Well, I'd sure like to know
It only goes to show
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Sooner or later one of us must know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
The only one I know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
I send you all my money
Though I'd never say
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
How many times must the cannon balls fly
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
To those condemned to act accordingly
But you can never steal away
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
For them that must obey authority
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
The Spanish-American War had its day
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
That I was just a puppet in a play
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
No, you'll not now or no other day
She knocked upon it anyway
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
A cock is crowing far away
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
For them that think death's honesty
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
So I run down most hurriedly
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
She puts it to me plain as day
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
From phony jealousy
But I can't deny
We banged the drum slowly
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
So they took him to the infirmary
Or if you just want some company
The same thing I would want today
But I wish there was something you would do or say
And the only tune my guitar could play
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
He made the bells of freedom ring today
So, I'm walking down your highway
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Someone to get you flowers constantly
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Is worth more than I could pay
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
And that which you've given me today
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Spouted out that liberty
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
And the ladies treat me kindly
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Went to the doctor the very next day
I did not do it harmfully
And for His love they took His life away
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
My ears hear a symphony
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Maggie says that many say
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
That I done it the way
For them that think death--death's honesty
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Don't you tell Henry
My mind weaves a symphony
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
If I don't take the chance to try
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
She starts to speak, but he walks away
She smiles, walks the other way
And I'm leaving every day to run away
And it's up to you to say
