He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Yippee!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
They was all over!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Alright, now!
She's insane!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Yeah, man!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Yes, come out your window!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Take me down to California, baby!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Woo-hoo!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
You must think I'm crazy!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Good God!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
I got the freight train blues!
I ain't different than anyone!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Dignity never been photographed!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
I wanna be yours!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Lordy, Lord!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
They got away!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Oh, yeah!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
I'm in love with you!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
I've got a million friends!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Play that guitar now!
Alright!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Start over!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Dance!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Betty Ross!
Them Reds did it!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
My God, they killed Him!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
How they ever flood my soul!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Hootenanny television!
Well!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
It was the mailman!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Oh!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
I've got the freight train blues!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
He punched me out!
So long, New York!
Goodnight!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Oh, no!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Thank you!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Woo!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Howdy, East Orange!
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
We want folksingers here."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
I'll endow them onto thee."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
I can't find my knees."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Get on your horse and ride away."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
They look as dark as night."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Have it on Highway 61."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Will mourn for your return."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And it's all for the love of thee."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
I didn't see you around."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Has kindly assisted me home."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
From across that lonesome ocean."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
You and I'll never know."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
And keep him good company."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
You can't blame us at all."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Tangled up in blue."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Country'll grow."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
For that reason I will have to stay."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
He said, "Tell me about it."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
But we were tangled up in blue."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
You can't blame me at all."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
And punched my cigarette."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Where you and I will unite."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Would kill a little bird like me."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
I'll bring back my lady."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
So write to her tenderly."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And hung on a willow tree."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
And have it on Highway 61."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
We'll both go home together."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
It's all for the love of thee."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
I would want again tomorrow."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"Have you seen dignity?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
That you must always first forgive them."
Come flowing down so free?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
"That way down Highway 61."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
They look as white as snow."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
But I know what you want."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
We'll both go off together."
You must know about my debutante."
I love far better than thee."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
God said, "On Highway 61."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
And pretend that you never have met."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Far away in the stormy night,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
It still ain't me, babe,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
And I'm so glad,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
It's like I ain't here,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Well, the job that you used to have,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
I have no one to meet,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Heart of mine,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Tell me,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Well, get sick, get well,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
And you make love just like a woman,
It always means so much,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
And played the fife lowly,
While paupers change possessions,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
I just don't know what to do,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Like as not, it's better so,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
She'll surely turn to white,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Watching the river flow,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Give you my money, honey,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
One by one they followed the sun,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
She once was a true love of mine,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
You had enough of hatred,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
I had no one for to go my bail,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
They say every distance is not near,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
But I know that he don't talk,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Don't let yourself fall,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Father of night, father of day,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
They tell me every man must fall,
Far away from it all,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
The country doctor rambles,
You to me were true,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Icicles hanging down,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
He's young and on fire,
Well, I may just swear,
And, though the line is cut,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Someone to open each and every door,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
She leave by the other and roam,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
But you were gambling for support,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Till both of us fell by the way,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
And she'll be coming forth,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
From their fates try to resign,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Is it really any wonder,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Try hard, get barred,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
And not going through any great extreme,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Out to the windy beach,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
True love, they've been without it,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Resent him to the bone,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Three angels up above the street,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
"Not I," said the referee,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
I can't cross the line, you know,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Searching high, searching low,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
That one doctor cannot save him,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
I don't care if you analyze me,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
That you'd have liked me to,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Since you've been gone,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
They keep it all hid,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
I went into the red, went into the black,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Strike another match, go start anew,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Looking for a new fool,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
My dear, sweet friend,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
My woman's never sitting at home,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Or select you or dissect you,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Need a woman all the time,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
But you're doing it again,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
In the shadows of moonlight,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Don't let her see that you need her,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
The night passed away so quickly,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Into my own parade,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Hmm, I can make it through,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
He won't do nothing to you,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Pick you up every time you fall,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Why she did go,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
On the stone that remains,
By losers, cheaters,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Front door shut, back door too,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Carved next to his name,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
To protect his white skin,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
How he died nobody can say,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
That long, black train is pulling down,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
The one we can see and can feel,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
We take great delight in our own company,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Over the hills and far away,
All the tired horses in the sun,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Just like a rolling stone,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
The winter would hold no spring,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
You're beautiful to me,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
I got my mind made up,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
You gotta look some other place,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Oh, in somebody's room,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
At ships with tattooed sails,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
I can make it through,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
The sky too is folding over you,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
In the ruins of your balcony,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
All I really wanna do,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Every brain is civilized,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
I got a wife and five little children,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Ye shall be a-changed,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Tell her not to worry,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
It's a price I have to pay,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
It don't matter what you did,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Don't matter what you did,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
At the close of the day,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Where I will always be renewed,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
They say every man must fall,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
I went down where the vultures feed,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Badge out, laid off,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Vanished from my hand,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
And I will not carry myself down to die,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Going,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
To gather flowers constantly,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
But I'm saved,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Don't let her hear,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
A question in your nerves is lit,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
In the end,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
For all intended purposes,
Five by five they tried to survive,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
God knows it's terrifying,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Without ideals or violence,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
May you stay forever young,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
To be out on your own,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Paradise, sacrifice,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Yet every distance is not near,
Don't wear sandals,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Under the microscope,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Just like I did before,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
I had so much left to do,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Trouble,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
But, if you want me to,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Go down to the river, babe,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
A true love of mine,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Look who's back in town,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
It could even be like a myth,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Without your sweet love,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
That can do what's a-never been done,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
But evidently she don't,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Joey, Joey,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
They say every man needs protection,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Don't put yourself over the line,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Went back home to the yard,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
In love and with kindness,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
You'll change your last name, too,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
In the great unknown,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Stay away from the train line,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
I got no place left to turn,
Never weak, but always strong,
And forget my pride,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Going, going,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
And I got those worried blues,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
But you try with your whole soul,
Stripping away at it all,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
You and me, we had completeness,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
I wish tonight were here,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
This world is ruled by violence,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
And on the highway of regret,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Equality, liberty,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
It hurts me, too,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
God don't call it wrong,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
My limbs are shaking,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Can't find what I need,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
I just don't see why I should even care,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Got my mind made up,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
I shall be released,
Name of Martin Luther King,
You got something better,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Gonna serve somebody,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
But it would not be new,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
And the point is slick,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
My love, she speaks softly,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Want you so bad,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
So, never leave me lonely,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
My arms and legs were broken,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
I'm going out of my mind,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Stand up straight and tall,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
I bless the day I found you,
Don't tie no bows,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
So unknown,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
For her to arrive,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
For the politician's gain,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Puffing on a big cigar,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Made of silver or of golden,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
He is centuries old,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
For she ain't the same,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
You're beautiful beyond words,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Had no one to go my bail,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
While riding on a train going west,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
She said she would never forget,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Six months on the chain gang,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
You'll be doing society a favor,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I know I can't win,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
With the juice running down my leg,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Advertising signs, they con,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
I been good while I been waiting,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
God knows there's a heaven,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
To find out if she's talked,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
You got something I want plenty of,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Don't ever try to change me,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
I want my arms around you,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Stone you just like they said they would,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
And may you stay forever young,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
And it's like I ain't here,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
She'll be coming forth,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Just remember that death is not the end,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Well, come all without, come all within,
It's really something,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Keep me where you are,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
By rivers of blindness,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
The day you quit me, baby,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Look out, kid,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
There's always someone who understands,
That must be what it's all about,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Don't steal, don't lift,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
God knows you've got to weep,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
And point away from the past,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
If ever I prove false to you,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
She's opened up a happy home,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
A thousand miles from home,
I got the worried blues,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
All you can do is do what you must,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Baby, please stop crying,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
A complete unknown,
Honey, just for you to climb,
I need a shot of love,
Said I'm pressing on,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
God knows it's a struggle,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Is looking for a new fool,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
To be without a home,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
And furnish me with tape,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Well, the way I love that woman,
I'd already gone the distance,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
I can finish this alone, honey,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Ye shall be changed,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Just don't know what to do,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
And give him back the time he's done,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Waiting for the trains,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Going home,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Poverty and shame was theirs,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
If not for you,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
And rivers that ran through every day,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
One by one they follow the sun,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
And I'm back in the rain,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Wintertime in New York town,
And she makes love just like a woman,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
You can raise up your right hand,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
I'm leaving today,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
We've killed each one,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
It always has hit me from below,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Don't mind the driving rain,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
A man named Martin Luther King,
They say that every man must fall,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Father of black, father of white,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
A hand set the spark,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Never did feel this way before,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
They say everything can be replaced,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I won't have my nature way,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
And she aches just like a woman,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
I never can go because, you know,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
And to come each time you call,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Of this I can't say very much,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Tell me that you love me only,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
God knows it's fragile,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Winter would have no spring,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Father of air and father of trees,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Corrina, Corrina,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Holding his club like he was a king,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
All the silver, all the gold,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
We live in a political world,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
The day would surely have to break,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
And think they're fooling you,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
The sky too is folding under you,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
One by one until there were none,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
But the time ain't tall,
Watered-down love,
Where life and death are memorized,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Love don't have any place,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Thinking about the government,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
The haunted, frightened trees,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
You even make love just like a woman,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Strangers all give me the news,
But he's the property of Jesus,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Who will promise never to part,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Father of minutes, father of days,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
In the hills of mystery,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Went to the station down in the yard,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
To shine in through,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Don't let her see,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Like you never did before,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Simplify you, classify you,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
People carry roses,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
But now morning is clear,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
To be on your own,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
When I was in Missouri,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Come on, come on, stick together,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
God don't call it treason,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Go melt back in the night,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Each one playing a horn,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Spent my money on you, honey,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
But I'm pressing on,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
You have given me eyes to see,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
God knows it's a crime,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Broken hands on broken plows,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
She never does me wrong,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
And the table's full and overflowed,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Every nerve is analyzed,
The angels play on their horns all day,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Pressing on,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
I'm going back to Colorado,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
That fellow who never blushes,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
I can change, I swear,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Giving back all of what you owe,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
I don't care if you feel like me,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Ooh, watered-down love,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Forever young, forever young,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
But it ain't him to blame,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
If she ain't feeling well,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
No direction home,
Every head is so dignified,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
But the bottles are done,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
It was you who came right through,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Each time we meet, love,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
May be living in another country under another name,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
And I got the worried blues,
Father of loneliness and pain,
And there's two white horses following me,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Broken lines, broken strings,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
And your streets are getting empty,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
You broke a heart that loved you,
No, nothing was delivered,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
If you'd see me this way,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Whether you are right or wrong,
But, if I can save you any time,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
To be one your own,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
And I'm just like that bird,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
People talk over situations,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Hang around the ink-well,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
To be––direction home,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
It was from her ship sailing,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
I try my best to be like I am,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
You were striped, you were plain,
Two by two they step in the dark,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I'm going down the river,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
People going down to the ground,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
It's alright,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
With his fist in a clinch,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
God knows there's a purpose,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
If'n you don't know by now,
Don't you tell Henry,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
God knows how to make it flow,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
You got to serve somebody,
I don't wanna fake you out,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Up and down the block,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
In the foggy web of destiny,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Ever since I been a child,
Courage is a thing of the past,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I'm never, never far from home,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Using every angle under the sun,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
God knows when,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
But, deep inside my heart,
A dream about you, baby,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
And I'm in the shade,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
A million faces at my feet,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I can't understand,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
God knows it's true,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I got a bird that whistles,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Stone you when you are young and able,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Carry the New York Times,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
The air is getting hotter,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Don't let me change my heart,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
With no direction home,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
And to come every time you call,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
In the lonely night,
Just then the order came to charge,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
But, it ain't me, babe,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Searching everywhere I know,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
In the darkness of my night,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
You married young just like your ma,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Better jump down the manhole,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
The only son of God Almighty,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Too noble to neglect,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Go away from my window,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
But I would not feel so all alone,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Father of day, father of night,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
By users, cheaters,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Trust yourself,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
You've got to serve somebody,
Like a complete unknown,
God knows everything,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Drifting too far from shore,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
I thank the Lord,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Dream about you, baby,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
But it ain't me, babe,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
I'd only have to stay,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
I got two white horses following me,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
If you throw it all away,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Someone to close his heart,
Of ancient history,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Grandpa died last week,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Well, I can't understand,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
You follow, find yourself at war,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
You can run down to the desert,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Three by three they're turning the key,
The joint is jumping,
First degree and second degree,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Newspapermen eating candy,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
I would not feel so all alone,
Don't wanna be a bum,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Ah, get sick, get well,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Saved,
Over your senses you have no control,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Stone you and say good luck,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Keep a clean nose,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
True love of mine,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
That the laws are with him,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Staying far behind without you,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Where mercy walks the plank,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Private reasons, great or small,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Oh, see what you can do,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
So glad,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
They must bust in early May,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Is used, it is plain,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
The light I never knowed,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
You have given everything to me,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
I rambled out of New York town,
If I didn't have to guess,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Loyalty, unity,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
How many a year has passed and gone,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
In his anger and his shame,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
God sees it all unfold,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Bring the wife and family,
If your time to you is worth saving,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I once held her in my arms,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Don't let me drift too far,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Oh, singing just for you,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Who among them would try to impress you,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
With what your fate is going to be,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
I fell down to my bended knees,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
You stole her love from me one day,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
The man in the trench-coat,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Eh, singing just for you,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I'm so glad,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
You wanna drown love,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
The kingdoms of experience,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Just to know that you are near,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
You better chew gum,
It's too bad he had to go,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Madams light the candles,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
I went into the city, into the town,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
And it ain't me, babe,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Tears on the letter that I write,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Bringing me all of your charms,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
I been good,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
People talk of situations,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
The night blows cold and rainy,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Somewhere down the road some day,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
If you must cling to someone,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Dust on my face and my cape,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Fare thee well but for a while,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
But, if I will save you the time,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
In the instant that I preach,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
And, if I see the day,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Adiós, mi corazón,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Eh, and you are on dry land,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
How does it feel,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Relationships of ownership,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
I just keep pressing on,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Heart of mine, go back home,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
When I seen him lose control,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
They say every man need protection,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Don't try No Doz,
For his age he is wise,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Nothing was delivered,
This situation can only get rougher,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
The Second World War came to an end,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
I can't be good, baby,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
As his youth now unfolds,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Precious angel under the sun,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Oh, watered-down love,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
You have explained every mystery,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Ain't no going back,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Make you spin or do you in,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
But I will be back, I will survive,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Father of cold and father of heat,
He got that soft, silky skin,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
And you take just like a woman,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
More people kept a-piling on,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Like a dog on a chain,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Looking 'bout the government,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
With a killer's pride, security,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
When the night comes falling,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I've been in and out of happiness,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
I get my sweet reward,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
To hang and to lynch,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Something about you that I can't shake,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Get back, write Braille,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Father who build the mountain so high,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Serve somebody,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Thieving in the alley,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
I threw it all away,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
May be an actor in a plot,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
You always responded when I needed your help,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
I wish I a-was a magician,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
All them prophets good and gone,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
But he can't be blamed,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Want you,
Mixing up the medicine,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Cares not to come up any higher,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
You can stick your head in the sand,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
They don't believe in mercy,
And come every time you call,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I went back home, put on my tie,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Judge and jury took their stand,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Maybe when we both get sober,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
My senses have been stripped,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
As the present now will later be past,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
You have given all there is to give,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
And ye shall be a-changed,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
For the wise men and the fools,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
And it still ain't me, babe,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Not the end, not the end,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
And I––I walk out on my own,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
In the turning of twilight,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Don't follow leaders,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
And I know what you're thinking of,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Every lady in the land told him lies,
That fired the gun,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
The country music station plays soft,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Going, going, gone,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
China doll, alcohol,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Love that's pure no accident,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Like some mystery,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
You will be alright, girl,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Without a love of my own,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
To be alone with you,
That can do what's never been done,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
But I've been hanging on,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Better jump down a manhole,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Heart of mine, be still,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
And also by his feet,
Precious father, loving mother,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
She said she would always stay,
To know how much I really care,
So many roads, so much at stake,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
On this new morning, new morning,
As I travel down life's pathway,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
I found my world, found my world in you,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Face full of black soot,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
New morning,
Or have done something wrong,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
You need something to open up a new door,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I should have left this town this morning,
And, if I can save you any time,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
That her father was going to hang,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Without a dream in my heart,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
They lowered him down as a king,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
See her in that very tight skirt,
And, although that we're single and free,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
When she lays upon the grass,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
If anything is gonna sell,
Try to be a success,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Don't let her know,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Don't let her know that you love her,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
She would have married me,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
But something has changed,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
They say every man must need protection,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
I think we better talk this over,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
The night would see me wide awake,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
To stay closer than any friend,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
And you know I could never be your own,
Well, well, well,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
To a solid rock,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Well, I gave you all my money,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Who could they get to carry you,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
He's not selling any alibis,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
I long to see you in the morning light,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
And here I sit so patiently,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
That foreign sound in your ear,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
He been around the world and back again,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
God knows it's outta sight,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Laying low,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
A man with a badge skips by,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
If today was not a crooked highway,
For something that he never done,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
They––they show me to the door,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Like a rolling stone,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Far away and over the wall,
I'd be sad and blue,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
It all seemed so well-timed,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
You don't have to feed me,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Get born, keep warm,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
There she come, now, down my way,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
You need something to open your eyes,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Circled by the circus sands,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Watch the river flow,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
I've been around this whole country,
Memory, ecstasy,
And the whole world is on your case,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Come all without, come all within,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
God knows that, when you see it,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
So I got those worries blues,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Speaking to some French girl,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
She got great big hind legs,
How he died nobody could say,
You could look at it and weep,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
See you fly or watch you die,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Yesterday's just a memory,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
To strict party-platform ties,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Got me a secret membership card,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
In a pine box for all eternity,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Friends with you,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I went into the city, went into the town,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
He's the property of Jesus,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
I can see the turning of the key,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Aim well, my little one,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
When all will be well,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
You made it there somehow,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
And every cause that ever I fought,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Look away, you rolling river,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
And gathering storms may arise,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
I want you so bad,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
If you'd see me this a-way,
To keep up his hate,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
"Not me," said his manager,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Hmm, see what you can do,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
We'll fly the night away,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
And, if anybody asks me,
But, to remain as friends,
I went down to scrub and rub,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Light yourself a candle,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Mercury, gravity,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
"Come along and take a trip,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
To your tambourine in time,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Well, I'm so glad,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
God knows there's a river,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
You want watered-down love,
Automobile coming into style,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
You were snow, you were rain,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
My woman needs it every day,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
I been riding the midnight train,
When there is no more,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Nothing too very scientific,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Oh, Angelina,
You have given me life to live,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Seven days,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
I want you,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
To be so useless and all,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
To have––be on your own,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
I like the way that you move your hips,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Thank You, Lord,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Analyze you, categorize you,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
The beat is pumping,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I'll be on my way,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
One more night the stars are in sight,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
It's rising up above my head,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
When God and man will be reconciled,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Eh, see what you can do,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
God knows there's a chance,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
I got those worried blues,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Too serious to fool,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
I just say no thanks,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
In one the surface was frozen,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Well, I don't mind dying,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Day you quit me, baby,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
That's where you belong --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Democracy don't rule the world --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Calling out that he's been framed.
And your golden loom.
So, darling, you better come through.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
And disregards the rest.
Nobody stops to ask why.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Most of the time.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
With the golden loom.
Trust yourself.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
I will only let you down.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
That Johanna's not here.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Someone who will die for you and more.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
If you just let me come home with you.
May you stay forever young.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Figuring a way to get back home.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
Where I was born and partly raised.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
And gives it to me for a song.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
"And stay all night with me.
To see what kinda words he could say.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
But mine was a little different, you see.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Ever since I seen her smile.
At not getting their money's worth.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
But I would never do you wrong.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
Chain you down or be your clown.
I don't know.
I can't hear you anymore.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
While evening slips away.
Everything is gonna be alright.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
I have heard rumors all over town.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Father of love and father of rain.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
My mind is breaking.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
But the fighter still remains.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
And tapestry of rhyme.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I just can't do what I done before.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
And the Santa Fe.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
He never did know what it was all about.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
And try to avoid the scandals.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I'd be lost if not for you.
And you must realize the danger.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
See him at play makes me smile.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.

'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
I once held her in my arms.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
And he was a friend of mine.
And that failure's no success at all.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
I know something is changed.
But I never yet found Fennario.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
That which is not permanent don't last.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
I hate bears.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
And clouds cover up the ground.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
She acts like we never met.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
I don't even know why we come.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Ever since I seen you there.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
He gone north for a while.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Means another poor boy is underground.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
You don't have to worry any more.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Hope I don't blow it.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
And it is time for me to slide.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
He's always on trial for just being born.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
I'm going where I never been before.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
His mama sure was proud of him.
To keep her from the howling winds.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
Join the army if you fail.

Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.

Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
'Steada acting like we never met.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Come over here from over there, girl.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Throw my suitcase out there too.

For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Said it was a bad dream.
She's in some foreign land.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
I think this time we should escape.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
When I paint my masterpiece.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Like you never done before.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Without ideals or violence.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
Memories of what used to be.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Just crying out that he was framed.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
That brave and devoted band.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
At the end of the trail.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
What some people are gonna do for money.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
I want you.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.

For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.

He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Her fond face pale with woe.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
All my connections too.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.

Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.

But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
To the sin of love's false security.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
And I was brought up by my brother.
But simply because it's true.
Oh, Angelina.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.

They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.

But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.

I was looking around, I was outta sight.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Dollar a day's worth.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.

A foreign sound to your ear.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Behind a man's brain.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
With the glory that is to be.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Mortality, reality.
And your highway's getting filled.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
And you only got ten.
In this concrete world full of souls.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.

There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Yes, tell me.
Walking around with no one else.

You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Funny way to start a picnic.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
I had something to protect.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Gonna serve somebody.
As if a wedding vow.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.

If you just once drive me outta my mind.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
I got trouble in my mind.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Your old road is rapidly aging.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
You to me were the best.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
When I'm alone with you.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Girls like birds fly away.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
And pretend that we never have touched.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
I can't see through it anymore.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Baby, let me follow you down.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Until my dying-day.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.

If you just let me follow you down.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
And no time to think.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
It always does when you're with me.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
And light on your right knee.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Last radio is playing.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
I seen a man.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
You're on the bottom.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
You got a heart of stone.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
What you'll say when you get home.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.

People are expecting a false peace to come.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
It was a normal day.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Honey, I never would have come.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
In an oil refinery.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
I'm falling in love with you.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
In the brightness of my day.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Or put up against the wall.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
I want everybody to be free.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
You're a big girl all the way.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
The last radio is playing.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Is tearing up your mind.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
That's really and truly an American.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
That can win what's never been won.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
When she's better only time'll tell.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
You can make it too.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.

Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
And the people that confronted him were many.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
I got a bird that sings.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Step lightly on the ground.
It only brings me sorrow.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Leading me, going home.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Every link was Jesus's name.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
You cast your spell and I went under.

You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
People bending broken rules.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Going, going, gone.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Got my mind made up.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
The National Guard stands around the door.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Is just equality in school.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
No kindred or relative nigh.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
I remember her whispering yet.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
It can't be this way everywhere.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
God knows...
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Can't see over to the other side.
Lay dead beside him there.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Baby, please come home.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Thought I was a communist.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
It's just the old American way.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Everything is broken.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
And I's left alone with three children.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Evidently she won't.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
In the border-towns of despair.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Baby, two feet from the well.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
To live it you had to explode.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
And she had left him to die in there.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Mary wore three links of chain.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
I shall be released.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
It don't matter anyhow.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Without a love of my own.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Is what this thing here is for.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
"Don't trill no news on me.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
He ain't-a got no name.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
When you go your way and I go mine.
She just acts like we never have met.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
For me to return to or chase.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Epitome, rigidity.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Go lightly on the ground.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
When my memory is not so short.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
Hope that it don't sleet.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
I can't fire them anymore.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
That must be what it's all about.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Turned on my record player.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Patriotism, materialism.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Bring that bottle over here.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
My love winks, she does not bother.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Please let me ride you home.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
When my working day's through.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Your voice was all that I heard.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
I know you always say that you agree.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
You don't have to be afraid.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
They would not let me be.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
His voice was low with pain.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
For that's the way I remember her best.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Wants to get it paid off.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
I never saw the man again.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
From the little Minnesota town.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
Rain would gather too.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
All because his face was brown.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Rain would gather, too.
That just struck me kinda funny.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
That old ship was a-going down.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Broken voices on broken phones.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
You sound like a hillbilly.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
It's that million dollar bash.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Crumble into one another.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
With an iron chain around his neck.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Some place so high above the wall.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Life don't mean a thing.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
You know, I loved her just the same.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Hmm.
I's looking around just to see myself.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
In the dark land of the sun.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Is when I'm alone with you.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
Trying to create a next world war.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
If not for you.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
You're a big girl now.
Going through all these things twice.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
Blood on your saddle.
I'll hold it down for you.
To know which way the wind blows.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Now you don't talk so loud.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Come on, honey.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
I'm younger than that now.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Never will want for money.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
If'n you don't know by now.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
High society, notoriety.
Everybody must get stoned.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
The words that her lover had said.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
The whole night through.
New morning.
Who says she knows me well.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
In my Cadillac.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
What's real and what is not.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
See that my grave is kept clean.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Honey, baby.
Drink up your blood like wine.
I took some comfort there.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
She once was a true love of mine.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
When he played and we didn't dance.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
My baby took my heart from me.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
And there's no time to think.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
It hurts me, too.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
And laid his life on the line.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
An innocent man in a living hell.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
But with the country to where you're going.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Even before you came in the door.
Everybody that was hanging out.
I'm just average, common too.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
She said she would always stay.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
He's only a pawn in their game.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And guarded them as they fell.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
While I'm in the hall.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Got ice water in my veins.
As the present now will later be past.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Your son is coming back from the war.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Looking for a new friend.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
But it was more than I could do.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
So quickly into autumn.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
The place that I started from.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
Everything is gonna be fine.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
With your golden loom.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
They want me for a gambling fight.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
Heart of mine.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Where teardrops fall.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
And she'll only know he's dead.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
I did not do it knowingly.
And I've never been too impressed.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Billy, you been running for so long.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
A true love of mine.
And all your raging glory.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
In the pale moonlight.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
I'll only let you down.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Feel further away than ever before.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
That I left in the French Quarter.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Go find out something only dead men know.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
You always got more than enough rope.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
To anything I might have tried.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
For the times, they are a-changing.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
68, but says she's 24.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
Down to New Orleans.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
She pretends like we never have met.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
I see that stationmaster too.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Unless they're from another world.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
You only got ten.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
I'd like to know.
I always thought that he was well.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Carry for you deep down inside.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Is gonna be against the law.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Just like so many times before.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Until I threw it all away.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
That's the way I remember her best.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
You'll do as much for me.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Just you and me.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Just remember that death is not the end.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
"Don't point your finger at me.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Oh, yes, they did.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Orders from the D.A.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
And I need you, yeah.
With gold and silver in her hand.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Leave no stone unturned.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
But you're back where you belong.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Slowly into autumn.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Hope you're ready.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
I'd give anything to be with you.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
And relive my dreams.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
68, but says he's 24.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
And then unto eternity.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
That I really did try to get close to you.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Under the hedges.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
I can walk anytime around the block.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Oh, convey herself away.
Just what he was talking about.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Hoping you'll come through too.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Good car to drive, after a war.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
In fond memory appear.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
You won't get it for money.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Everything inside is made of stone.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
I hope I'm ready.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
That linger in the fireball heat.
I long to reach for you in the night.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
You're my honey.
Need that woman straight and true.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Friends with you.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
They found him dead in the street one day.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Good as I been to you.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
The sooner you can leave.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
You want a watered-down love.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
Just what this song is all about.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
With all these promises you left for me.
Looking for the places only they would know.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
If I ride back again.
Come on, baby...
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Put me outta doors.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
I got nothing to go back to now.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
We were the wrong side.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Lost time is not found again.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
And make promises by the hours.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
There's no words that need to be said.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
It runs both cold and deep.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
At my window with a broken wing.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Crying out that he been framed.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Blues wrapped around my head.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
When you made everybody pay.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Ever since we've been apart.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
Even the softest touch.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
I froze right to the bone.
For she once was a true love of mine.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
You can show me a new place to start.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
And keep away from pranks.
Duality, mortality.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Bid farewell forever.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
That number eleven was closing.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
The hour when the ship comes in.
To anything I might've tried.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Soft as music, light as spring.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
Mama, you are on my mind.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
And one day he came passing by.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
If you throw it all away.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
And watch the parking meters.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
From my toes up to my ears.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Lord, protect my child.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Going back where we come from.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
And crime don't have a face.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Everybody's having them dreams.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Right now I'm having trouble.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Some place so high above this wall.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Baby, baby...
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
I'm a poet, I know it.
If it just don't make me hurts.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
But you're not even sure what it is.
I finally got a job in New York town.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
I see better days and I do better things.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Or define you or confine you.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
A man named Martin Luther King...
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
I can't fight them anymore.
I just can't see through it anymore.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Till I come into New York town:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Serve somebody:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
His epitaph plain:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Yeah, serve somebody:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Man is opposed to fair play:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
But there's one promise, darling:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Crumble into one another;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Some speak of the future;
All lies and jest;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
About everybody that was hanging out;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
I find complete love;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Had to be held down by big police;
Make promises by the hour;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>

<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>

<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
How much poison did they inhale?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Before they're forever banned?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
For all these earthly things?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Is it rolling, Bob?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
And how does it feel?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Have they missed you?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
And one deserving of affection?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Who killed Davey Moore?
What would life be?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Oh, so why not you and me?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
How can I live for You?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
That too many people have died?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
How many more without any reward?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Across the swooping plain?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's wrong with you this time?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
When he's standing in front of you?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
What good am I?
Just what in the world has come over you?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
To love and follow His direction?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Just like a rolling stone?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Gal, where you been so long?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Baby, can't you tell?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
What can I do for You?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Before he can hear people cry?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Can I come home with you?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Too many people have died?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Where did you lose your wings?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Are you ready?
But am I still dreaming yet?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Has anybody seen my love?
Before it's washed to the sea?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
When did you leave heaven?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Where did you hide your halo?
How can you say he will haunt you?
How many paths did they try and fail?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Before he can see the sky?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Am I ready?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Am I still dreaming yet?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
What else can a poor boy do?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Did you respect me for what I did?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Don't you remember making baby love?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
How does it feel?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Does anyone even try?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Why would I want to take your life?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Like a rolling stone?
By golly, what more can I say?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Of everything you see?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Before you call him a man?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
How could they let you go?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why and what's the reason for?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many more can they afford?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
How's everything in heaven?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Baby, can I come home with you?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
How could they ever mistake you?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Must everybody bow?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Can you get back in?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Across the swamp of time?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
How many compared to yesterday?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
What can I give to You?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Who you thought you were talking to?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, the dog collar's from India
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
"Equality". I spoke the word
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Now you don't seem so proud
He wagged his tail and shook his head
I'll always thank the Lord
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
And things would be different the next time we wed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
And your trouble is you know it too good
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
While some, on principles baptized
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Silvio, silver and gold
All the sweethearts you can hold
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
I run right home and I went to bed
I've been walking around
Many times I've often prayed
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
By no special friend
Somebody seen him hanging around
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
You used to be so amused
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
For what you sold that's not been received
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And those whom doom and death had spared
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
But something has changed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
But she ain't gonna find the road
They took a clean-cut kid
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
He was a clean-cut kid
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
It's something you did
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
She let go of my hand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
I will not go down under the ground
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Its iron claws attached
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
So I'll make my stand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
How many times can a man turn his head
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Just what you had in mind
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Things would be different the next time we wed
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
I live in another world
And then you told me later as I apologized
And into the path you are hurled
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
There ain't nothing in this world
We live in a political world
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Nothing was delivered
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
I want you, baby, just to understand
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I thought that it was well-understood
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
The changes I was going through can't even be used
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Now, whenever I get up and
But now something has changed
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
You used––be so proud
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
To see him obviously framed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
As I stand upon the sand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
And that even the nobles get properly handled
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Maybe someday you will understand
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Now, a very great man once said
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Now you don't act so––so proud
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
What's probably got you baffled more
Just pick anyone
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
If dogs run free, why not me
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Where I could watch her waltz for free
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Breaking hearts up and down the line
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Con you into thinking that you're the one
I am homeless, come and take me
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Everybody's wearing a disguise
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
You say you're looking for someone
And you see why it's so unique to be
I'm ready for to fade
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
You into thinking you're the one
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
And her silver-studded phantom cause
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
As he rises to fame
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
How many ears must one man have
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Well, it's all new to me
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
So I look like a walking mountain range
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Full of hope and desire
Lies that life is black-and-white
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Taking care of somebody nice
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
All I feel is heat and flame
It's all new to me
On the rising curve
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
From the start by the rule
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
But I feel nothing for their game
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
And plenty time for good romance
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
She plunged him into well water where
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Mona tried to tell me
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Should I leave them by your gate
"It's only you that he does crave
She been gone
Maybe someday you will look back and see
What good am I then to others and me
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
You're not free to belong to me
I don't even notice she gone
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
It'll be with me unto the grave
Among the lovely people living free
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
They say don't come back no more
But it won't be over till they clear his name
The crashing waves roll over me
Little did I realize
A bed that is never mine
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
So, I called up the operator of time
And suddenly there appeared before me
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Looking at hands for the lines that were
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
And I ain't complaining none
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
And never sat once at the head of the table
And I would send a message
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
There were times when I was so lonesome
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
From all the plans they do pursue
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
You just pick anyone
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Well, six white horses that you did promise
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
To give the special one you seek a chance
I can survive and I can endure
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
"That I might be gone a long, old time
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I been wondering all about me
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Remember me to one who lives there
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
What about that millionaire
Knows there's no success like failure
Limited in sex they dare
While them that defend what they cannot see
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
So I remember every face
Remember me to the one who lives there
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
That she's the same one
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
You know, it's not even safe no more
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
You could almost think that you're seeing double
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
The man the authorities came to blame
I rode with him in a taxi once
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
How was I to know you'd be the one
Hunger pays a heavy price
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
When I'm all alone
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Up into some paradise
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Better stay away from those
She knows there's no success like failure
Though its shadow's metal badge
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Says it's closing time
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
What you're gonna say when you get home
Leaving men wholly, totally free
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Should I put them by your gate
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
When the roses fade
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
So up she picked her babies three
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
But the dark does die
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
"Oh, father, you will surely die
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
At dawn my lover comes to me
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
I do declare
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
We see this empty cage now corrode
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
When the rain is blowing in your face
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
You said you'd never compromise
But I can't say I sympathize
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I'm sure you're the one to blame
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And I'm just the same as anyone else
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
If dogs run free, why not we
And the Negro's name
To show you something you seen before
The cause was there before we came
Waiting to find out what price
Why wait any longer for the one you love
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
But I can get another one
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Just what you will say when you get home
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
He'll see by his grave
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
You cut to the core
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
With all memory and fate
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
If dogs run free, then what must be
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Oh, trust yourself
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
She rode by night and came by morning
And there's no telling who that it's naming
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
There's nothing in here moving
For your weary toes to be touching
You left me standing in the doorway crying
They're drinking up and walking
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
'Cause the battle outside raging
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Where the time and the tempo drag
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
I can hear their hearts a-beating
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
The battle outside raging
The order is a-rapidly fading
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Deceived me into thinking
For your weary toes to be a-touching
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
The order is rapidly fading
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Well, I set my monkey on the log
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
But then a whistle will be blowing
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
If I was with her too long
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
It's not a bad way to make a living
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Then she told us how times were tough
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Look out, the saints are coming through
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I have fallen far beneath
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And how I know I'll make it through
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
You go north and you go south
Well, there ain't no going back
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Make everything from toy guns that spark
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
But they caught him and they brought him back
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
You turn around to take a final peek
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Her voice once and talk
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
The man in me will do nearly any task
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Shoot in the back
I wish she'd unlock
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Muttering small talk at the wall
As the last fire-truck from hell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Oh, how does it feel
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
How many seas must the white dove sail
A girl by the whirlpool
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
How does it feel
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
He's sure got a lot of gall
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
And if my love is real
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Ring bar, hard to tell
All and all can only fall
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Well, if I die on top of the hill
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
A-how does it feel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Ring bell, hard to tell
They ask me how I feel
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
Then why don't she tell
He's taught in his school
To make all that should be killed to crawl
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
How many seas must a white dove sail
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Two eyes took the aim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And remain as I am
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
"For you cannot relive them
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But I can hear another drum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
You better not chew gum
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
I figure maybe we're even
"Not me," said the gambling man
Must meet the dawn
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Have died in battle or in vain
Their religion of the little ten women
But the second mom was with the seventh son
He got that fortress on the mountain
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Suicide remarks are torn
The foreign sun, it squints upon
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
You take just like a woman
But it's hard to think on
You don't need a weatherman
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
For the loser now will be later to win
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
You need something to make it known
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Yes, and someone must explain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Trying to get a lead on
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I'll be waiting at the station
But me, I expected it to happen
Well, I'm hanging on
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Why did you trade heaven
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
My love, she's like some raven
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Well, you fake just like a woman
Out of the shower comes a football man
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
But the post office has been stolen
To my knowledge there's just one man
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Uncle Rat went running downtown
The ones that jump on the wagon
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
To remember the times when I was your only man
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
The next morning she had awoken
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
But I swear I see my reflection
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
How many roads must a man walk down
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
She said that all the railroad men
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
And you ache a-just like a woman
In ceremonies of the horsemen
That long, black train is pulling down
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
As you sit on the box you keep him in
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And there's no exit in any direction
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
That long, black train is pulling on down
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
All their daughters put me down
But all their daughters put me down
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
From heights that they could not gain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
And she aches just like a woman
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
For the loser now might be later to win
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Darkness at the break of noon
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
How can the life of such a man
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Somebody new to beat on
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
And she wakes just like a woman
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
A-she takes just like a woman
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
She takes just like a woman
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
And all their daughters put me down
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
In the pigpen
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Guns and clubs followed him down
And the corner sign
Please don't let on that you knew me when
She got such a sweet disposition
Advertising signs that con
Yet I swear I see my reflection
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
All I really wanna do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Every place I wanna go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All I'd like you to do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
There's nothing you can say or do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Silvio, I gotta go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
The very last thing that I'd want to do
There is a place you go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
What good am I while you softly weep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
How many times must a man look up
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Aladdin and his lamp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
The man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Man in the coon-skin cap
I walked down there and ended up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Alone you stand with nobody near
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When only you are near
In one I was running and in another
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
She took him by his long, yellow hair
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
At any moment you could go under
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I say, "Why you say that for
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
For I am married to a house carpenter
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Still I've always kind of missed her
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Still I say her love-words over
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
I don't have to go far
I close my eyes and I wonder
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
So, don't fear if you hear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
I could feel a whole lot better
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
For all eternity I think I will remember
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
But morning is clear
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
All you boys better run for cover
Never no more do I wonder
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
The face of God will appear
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
And I don't even think about her
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
Who came here from Cuba's door
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
You heard me saying a prayer for
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
The wind howls like a hammer
The lover who has just walked out your door
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
When you whispered in my ear
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And tells me of her dreams
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
You should be made to wear earphones
Now, you must provide some answers
We living in times when men commit crimes
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And, though the masters make the rules
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
They whisper in the wings
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Glide across the lonely years
True love can make a blade of grass
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
He's not selling any alibis
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Her window's wide open, African trees
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
To memorizing politics
And I try to harmonize with songs
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
With a fantastic collection of stamps
That it's you and no one else that owns
You never turned around to see the frowns
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
And so Patty calls the cops
I'd gladly confess
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
People carry roses
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
I was thinking of a series of dreams
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Thinking of a series of dreams
At times I think there are no words
What good am I if I say foolish things
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
How many deaths will it take till he knows
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
"Not me," said the man whose fists
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Well, the ragman draws circles
Mama, you know, awaits the news
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Statues made of matchsticks
Don't wear sandals
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Good and bad, I define these terms
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
I let it slip gladly to my friends
The cowboy angel rides
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
As friends and other strangers
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
And the princess and the prince discuss
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Six-time users
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
I'm gonna let you pass
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
To sharpen the senses
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
And the poor white remains
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You know that he has no intentions
I try to tell it like it is
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Wants eleven dollar bills
Seven days
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
People on the platforms
With a big bouquet of the roses
You been hurt so many times
Romantic facts of musketeers
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
But still remains
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
To the cutting of fences
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And then complains
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Six-time losers
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
But, though the masters make the rules
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
You can fall down on your knees
And your father, to your sister he explains
Don't follow leaders
Girl by the whirlpool's
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Like a corkscrew to my heart
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Keep me set apart
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Someday, everything is gonna be different
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
You are there in the flickering light
Yet you know there is no answer fit
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
I got into the driver's seat
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
One more night the moon is shining bright
You're hearing my heart beat
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
The slowest now will later be fast
In the precious winds they rot
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And, since my feet are now fast
In the stillness of the midnight
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
I think that it's best
By the way, that's a cute hat
Wait for the morning light
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Everyone still talks about
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
How many years can some people exist
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
She seems too far out
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
You used to laugh about
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Keep it in your mind and not forget
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Everything is always right
To keep it in your mind and not forget
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
You're gonna get hit
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
And the first one now will later be last
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
You used to laugh–make fun about
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
He built a fire on Main Street
That might be all that you got
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
One more night I will wait for the light
Well, I finally started thinking straight
How many years can a mountain exist
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
With your pockets well protected at last
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
I soon get some rest
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
So he never thinks straight
I'm on the pavement
Johnny's in the basement
There's some people that
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
To hold each other tight
He really wasn't where it's at
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
They tell me revenge is sweet
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
And I, in my armor, turning about
The slow one now will later be fast
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Without any doubt
They tell me to be discreet
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
But, if the arrow is straight
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
You don't forget
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Talking that the heat put
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
It don't take too long to find out
Plants in the bed, but
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To be alone with you
It's just crazy being here with you
To protect you and defend you
And I tell this truth to you
I just might have to come see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I can be just like you
With only you in view
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
It only goes to show
He been living there three years now
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Yes, I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Well, I'd sure like to know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Sooner or later one of us must know
I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Don't it always a-go to show
Ring them bells for the chosen few
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
The only one I know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Don't it always go to show
Now, you're probably wondering by now
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
But sooner or later one of us must know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
But I wish there was something you would do or say
And that which you've given me today
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
My ears hear a symphony
A cock is crowing far away
So they took him to the infirmary
For them that must obey authority
And for His love they took His life away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
If I don't take the chance to try
No, you'll not now or no other day
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
But you can never steal away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
That I was just a puppet in a play
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Is worth more than I could pay
And the ladies treat me kindly
Spouted out that liberty
Though I'd never say
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
That I done it the way
I did not do it harmfully
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
And I'm leaving every day to run away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Or if you just want some company
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
I send you all my money
She starts to speak, but he walks away
The Spanish-American War had its day
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Don't you tell Henry
So, I'm walking down your highway
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
From phony jealousy
She puts it to me plain as day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
The same thing I would want today
She knocked upon it anyway
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
And the only tune my guitar could play
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
She smiles, walks the other way
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Maggie says that many say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Went to the doctor the very next day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
My mind weaves a symphony
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Well, I saw it advertised one day
How many times must the cannon balls fly
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And it's up to you to say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
But I can't deny
He made the bells of freedom ring today
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
For them that think death's honesty
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
For them that think death––death's honesty
We banged the drum slowly
So I run down most hurriedly
To those condemned to act accordingly
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
To know where you are –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Turn, turn, turn again –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Oh, my–
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Disconnect these cables––
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Havana–gee–
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Private reasons – great or small –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Hava–na–
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
I hope that you can hear––
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Indians camp along her border –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Hang out the whole next day –
Ha–va–
You will not hear a laugh –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
For seven long years I courted Sally –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
I got no idea what I want –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Havanagee–luh–
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Remember me to one who lives there –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
I long to hold you in the night –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
With notions his canoe was laden –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
It can't be this way everywhere –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
As suicide remarks are torn –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Ten thousand miles or more –
How badly they were shocked –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
That can win what's a-never been won –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
I'm sure it was not three –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
I a-hope you can hear––
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Leave all the children home –
With no other choice except but for to go –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
First degree and second degree –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Whispering your secret emotion –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
