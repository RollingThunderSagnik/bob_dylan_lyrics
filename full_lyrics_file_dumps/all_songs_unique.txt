"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Dignity never been photographed!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Goodnight!
Woo!
Them Reds did it!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
So long, New York!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Take me down to California, baby!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Yippee!
Yeah, man!
Dance!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Howdy, East Orange!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Oh, no!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Oh, yeah!
Thank you!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
I've got the freight train blues!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
I ain't different than anyone!
It was the mailman!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Well!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Play that guitar now!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Alright!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
My God, they killed Him!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
I got the freight train blues!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Start over!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
You must think I'm crazy!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Betty Ross!
Alright, now!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
I wanna be yours!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
He punched me out!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
They was all over!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
I've got a million friends!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
She's insane!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Yes, come out your window!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
I'm in love with you!
Lordy, Lord!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
How they ever flood my soul!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Woo-hoo!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Hootenanny television!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
They got away!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Good God!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"That way down Highway 61."
We'll both go off together."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
They look as white as snow."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Get on your horse and ride away."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
"Have you seen dignity?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
But we were tangled up in blue."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
You can't blame me at all."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
I'll endow them onto thee."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
I can't find my knees."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Tangled up in blue."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
We'll both go home together."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
You must know about my debutante."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Country'll grow."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
"Is it easy to forget?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Will mourn for your return."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I would want again tomorrow."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
We want folksingers here."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Have it on Highway 61."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
And pretend that you never have met."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Come flowing down so free?"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
They look as dark as night."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
He said, "Tell me about it."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
And it's all for the love of thee."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
You and I'll never know."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
I didn't see you around."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
I love far better than thee."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"I've had too much of your company,"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
And have it on Highway 61."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
And keep him good company."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
So write to her tenderly."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
And punched my cigarette."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
For that reason I will have to stay."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
That you must always first forgive them."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
It's all for the love of thee."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
But I know what you want."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Where you and I will unite."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
You can't blame us at all."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
God said, "On Highway 61."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
I'll see her soon, I know."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
I'll bring back my lady."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
And hung on a willow tree."
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
That four ears cannot hear him,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
And, if I can save you any time,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
One by one until there were none,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
This situation can only get rougher,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
The Second World War came to an end,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
We live in a political world,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
I threw it all away,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
I rambled out of New York town,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
To be on your own,
Analyze you, categorize you,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Father of day, father of night,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
When she lays upon the grass,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
But he's the property of Jesus,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Thieving in the alley,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
You were snow, you were rain,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
If anything is gonna sell,
But you were gambling for support,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
For all intended purposes,
Come on, come on, stick together,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
And I'm back in the rain,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
You don't want a love that's pure,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
With no direction home,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
All that and more and then some,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
I can change, I swear,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
They must bust in early May,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Cares not to come up any higher,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Hmm, see what you can do,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
To find out if she's talked,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
But I know that he don't talk,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
At ships with tattooed sails,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
You're beautiful beyond words,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
I had so much left to do,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
All you can do is do what you must,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Using every angle under the sun,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Had no one to go my bail,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
And I'm in the shade,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Ain't no going back,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
I try my best to be just like I am,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
How he died nobody can say,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
And to come each time you call,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
But, if I will save you the time,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
One more night the stars are in sight,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Poor boy never say die,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
I'm going back to Colorado,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
In one the surface was frozen,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
I got no place left to turn,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
I've been around this whole country,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Relationships of ownership,
And it ain't me, babe,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
If your time to you is worth saving,
And gathering storms may arise,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
The day would surely have to break,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I never can go because, you know,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
All the silver, all the gold,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
My love, she speaks softly,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Paradise, sacrifice,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Without ideals or violence,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
It always has hit me from below,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
God don't call it wrong,
I think we better talk this over,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
In the image of someone you used to know,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Laying low,
You were striped, you were plain,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Of this I can't say very much,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
All I really wanna do,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
The phone's tapped anyway,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
I had no one for to go my bail,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
The kingdoms of experience,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
I love you, pretty baby,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
You got something better,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Can't find what I need,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I'd be sad and blue,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
When the night comes falling,
Thinking about the government,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Wintertime in New York town,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
I'll go see them come down my way,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You need something to open up a new door,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Socialism, hypnotism,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
I'm going out of my mind,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Better jump down a manhole,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
I got a wife and five little children,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Well, I can't understand,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
God sees it all unfold,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
I'd only have to stay,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
In the lonely night,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
That fired the gun,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
She leave by the other and roam,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
My woman's never sitting at home,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Without a love of my own,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
He won't do nothing to you,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Advertising signs, they con,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Stripping away at it all,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Searching everywhere I know,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Eh, singing just for you,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
She'll surely turn to white,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
She said she would always stay,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Go melt back in the night,
Don't you tell Henry,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Get back, write Braille,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
With his fist in a clinch,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Oh, see what you can do,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Human gods aim for their mark,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
If you throw it all away,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Poor boy dressed in black,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
You'll change your last name, too,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Vanished from my hand,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
You got to serve somebody,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
The winter would hold no spring,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
"Not me," said his manager,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Of ancient history,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
On this new morning, new morning,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I been good while I been waiting,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
And all of your children start to resent you,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
You find God in the church of your choice,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
For the wise men and the fools,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
There's always someone who understands,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
And furnish me with tape,
No direction home,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
It's really something,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Father of time and father of dreams,
And there's two white horses following me,
Far away and over the wall,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Someone to open each and every door,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
I wish tonight were here,
Is it really any wonder,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Stay away from the train line,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Don't let her hear,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
You don't have to feed me,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
It's like I ain't here,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
She said she would never forget,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I just don't know what to do,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Silhouetted by the sea,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
When all will be well,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
I went into the red, went into the black,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
In the turning of twilight,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Dust on my face and my cape,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
May be living in another country under another name,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Read books and repeat quotations,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Speaking to some French girl,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
I'm leaving today,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
And, on their promises of paradise,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Automobile coming into style,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
I just say no thanks,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Under the microscope,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
She'll be coming forth,
Beating for the dead that rise,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Just like I did before,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Baby, please stop crying,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Spent my money on you, honey,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
I can make it through,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Tell me,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Just like a rolling stone,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Seven days,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
So I got those worries blues,
If you'd see me this a-way,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
A dream about you, baby,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
To your tambourine in time,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
To strict party-platform ties,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Light yourself a candle,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
And, although that we're single and free,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Circled by the circus sands,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Three angels up above the street,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Carved next to his name,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
You have given everything to me,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Hang around the ink-well,
Holding his club like he was a king,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Tell her not to worry,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
You can raise up your right hand,
Precious angel under the sun,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Don't let her know,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I have no one to meet,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Madams light the candles,
He been around the world and back again,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
I can't understand,
We've killed each one,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
You have given me life to live,
In another I witnessed a crime,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Better jump down the manhole,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
And, though the line is cut,
Where I will always be renewed,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
He's the property of Jesus,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
I'll be on my way,
And also by his feet,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
And, if I see the day,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Went back home to the yard,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
They don't believe in mercy,
It hurts me, too,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Simplify you, classify you,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
I just can't beg you anymore,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Made before the foundation of the world,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Thank You, Lord,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
God knows how to make it flow,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
I should have left this town this morning,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
They say every man must need protection,
And, if anybody asks me,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Up and down the block,
She got great big hind legs,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Yet every distance is not near,
I once held her in my arms,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
For the politician's gain,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Watch the river flow,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
As I travel down life's pathway,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
They walk among the stately trees,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Ye shall be changed,
You and me, we had completeness,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Face full of black soot,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
We never much thought we could get very old,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
People talk over situations,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
And played the fife lowly,
Every brain is civilized,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
We live and we die, we know not why,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Love don't have any place,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Six months on the chain gang,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Far past the frozen leaves,
She would have married me,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Eh, see what you can do,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
You better duck down the alleyway,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
But I will be back, I will survive,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Forever young, forever young,
Private reasons, great or small,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
You better chew gum,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Mercury, gravity,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Don't mind the driving rain,
You stole her love from me one day,
Father of loneliness and pain,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Going,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
In the darkness of my night,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
That you'd have liked me to,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
God knows it's fragile,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Friends with you,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Stone you and say good luck,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
I get my sweet reward,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
I got my mind made up,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
We take great delight in our own company,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I went back home, put on my tie,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Some things are too hot to touch,
God knows it's terrifying,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Like some mystery,
Where life and death are memorized,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
And on the highway of regret,
Yes, I want you so bad,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
All them prophets good and gone,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
The sky too is folding under you,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
I shall be released,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
With what your fate is going to be,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
But, deep inside my heart,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
To be––direction home,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Don't matter what you did,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
But the time ain't tall,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Like a complete unknown,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
How does it feel,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Aim well, my little one,
It's rising up above my head,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
It could even be like a myth,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Joey, Joey,
He is centuries old,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
If you'd see me this way,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
People talk of situations,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Yes, I'm so glad,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
They keep it all hid,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Where the neon madmen climb,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Out to the windy beach,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Far away from it all,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
You gotta look some other place,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And come every time you call,
To stay closer than any friend,
My limbs are shaking,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Too serious to fool,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
You to me were true,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
That one doctor cannot save him,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
"Not I," said the referee,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Don't tie no bows,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
The beat is pumping,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
With a killer's pride, security,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
But, to remain as friends,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Well, I been gambling so long,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
She never does me wrong,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I got two white horses following me,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
True love of mine,
Heart of mine, be still,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
For she ain't the same,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
They say every distance is not near,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
You have given all there is to give,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Oh, singing just for you,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Want you so bad,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Got me a secret membership card,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
God knows you ain't pretty,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Stand up straight and tall,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
I wish I a-was a magician,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Precious father, loving mother,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
A true love of mine,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
In the foggy web of destiny,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
You could look at it and weep,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Is looking for a new fool,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
I went into the city, into the town,
That fellow who never blushes,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
A complete unknown,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
God knows there's a chance,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Badge out, laid off,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
In love and with kindness,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
The day you quit me, baby,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
My hands can't feel to grip,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Come all without, come all within,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Try hard, get barred,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
When I was in Missouri,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Going, going,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
But I've been hanging on,
But, if I can save you any time,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
And I'm just like that bird,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Stone you just like they said they would,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Yes, and I'll go last,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
The sky too is folding over you,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
But it would not be new,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Don't know what to do without it,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Bring the wife and family,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Staying far behind without you,
By losers, cheaters,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Love that's pure no accident,
God knows there's a river,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Dream about you, baby,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
The joint is jumping,
Waiting for the trains,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Mixing up the medicine,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
First degree and second degree,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
A hand set the spark,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
That the laws are with him,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
That her father was going to hang,
Go down to the river, babe,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Giving back all of what you owe,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
May be an actor in a plot,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Got my mind made up,
It was you who came right through,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
In his anger and his shame,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
You have given me eyes to see,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Hold me, baby, be near,
The wind blowing the snow around,
In the ruins of your balcony,
You have explained every mystery,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
A million faces at my feet,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
See you fly or watch you die,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
I would not feel so all alone,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
High water rising, rising night and day,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
We'll fly the night away,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
You will be alright, girl,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
If I didn't have to guess,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Who will promise never to part,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
God knows you've got to weep,
It always means so much,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Don't ever try to change me,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
God knows when,
The wind howls like a hammer,
By users, cheaters,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
When there is no more,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Keep me where you are,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
To gather flowers constantly,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Looking for a new fool,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
You always responded when I needed your help,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Corrina, Corrina,
I'm so glad,
The one we can see and can feel,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
You even make love just like a woman,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
So, never leave me lonely,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Strangers all give me the news,
She's opened up a happy home,
Try to be a success,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Trust yourself,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
If not for you,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
My hands didn't touch him none,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
A man with a badge skips by,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Or select you or dissect you,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
While paupers change possessions,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
To keep up his hate,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
My woman needs it every day,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
I'm never, never far from home,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
I just keep pressing on,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Honey, just for you to climb,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Without your sweet love,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Over the hills and far away,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
I found my world, found my world in you,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
And I don't want to drag you down,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Well, I'm pressing on,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Make you spin or do you in,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
To protect his white skin,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
And they––they look at me and frown,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Just to know that you are near,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Is used, it is plain,
I'd give you the sky high above,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Look who's back in town,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Don't wear sandals,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
A thousand miles from home,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Never needed to call you my whore,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
True love, they've been without it,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
In the hills of mystery,
God don't call it treason,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Equality, liberty,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
God knows everything,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
And I got those worried blues,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Oh, watered-down love,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
To have––be on your own,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
People are crazy, times are strange,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
I want my arms around you,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Father of minutes, father of days,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Father of black, father of white,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Wasn't making any great connection,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Watered-down love,
As the daylight hours do increase,
You have laid down Your life for me,
That must be what it's all about,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
It was a girl I learned it from,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
God knows that, when you see it,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Too noble to neglect,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
You had enough of hatred,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
To be one your own,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Look away, you rolling river,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
My arms and legs were broken,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
And I know what you're thinking of,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
My senses have been stripped,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Not the end, not the end,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
A man named Martin Luther King,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Don't try No Doz,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
It still ain't me, babe,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Get born, keep warm,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
And may you stay forever young,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Well, I may just swear,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
For his age he is wise,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
But I'm saved,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
China doll, alcohol,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
I got those worried blues,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Since you've been gone,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Need a woman all the time,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
The country doctor rambles,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
New morning,
I thank the Lord,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
When I seen him lose control,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Want you,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
As the present now will later be past,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Without a dream in my heart,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
And you know I could never be your own,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Going, going, gone,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
I got the worried blues,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
You've got to serve somebody,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
While riding on a train going west,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Don't let me change my heart,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
God knows it's a struggle,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
At the close of the day,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Nothing too very scientific,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Five by five they tried to survive,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
That can do what's never been done,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
They say every man need protection,
Four by four, no illusion for,
One by one they followed the sun,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
To hang and to lynch,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
God knows there's a heaven,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
By rivers of blindness,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Every head is so dignified,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Don't let yourself fall,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Just don't know what to do,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
I can finish this alone, honey,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
And think they're fooling you,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
The path you've endured has been rough,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Looking 'bout the government,
Just then the order came to charge,
Seem like I been down this way before,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Or have done something wrong,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
I can see the turning of the key,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
One by one they follow the sun,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I've been all around the world, boys,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Well, well, well,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Never weak, but always strong,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
To know how much I really care,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Watch the plain-clothes,
That they do not respect in any degree,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Go away from my window,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
And here I sit so patiently,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Who could they get to carry you,
Like you never did before,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
You got something I want plenty of,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
A foreign sound to your ear,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Don't let her see,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
May you stay forever young,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
This place ain't doing me any good,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
The man in the trench-coat,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
So glad,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Into my own parade,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
They say every man must fall,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
You say my kisses are not like his,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
But evidently she don't,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
I try my best to be like I am,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
People carry roses,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
On the stone that remains,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
But, if you want me to,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
And point away from the past,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
To be without a home,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Hmm, I can make it through,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
That long, black train is pulling down,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
I run right home and I went to bed,
The Communists was a-coming around,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Saved,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
The light I never knowed,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
You follow, find yourself at war,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
I know I can't win,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
And I got the worried blues,
If you must cling to someone,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
And you take just like a woman,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Don't let yourself stumble,
If ever I prove false to you,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Searching high, searching low,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
And forget my pride,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
She once was a true love of mine,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
He's young and on fire,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
And I'm so glad,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
God knows it's a crime,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Living in the land of Nod,
And I––I walk out on my own,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Now you don't talk so loud,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Over your senses you have no control,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I don't care if you analyze me,
And she aches just like a woman,
God knows there's a purpose,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
But it ain't me, babe,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
To shine in through,
The train leaves at half past ten,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Going home,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I like the way that you move your hips,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
The only son of God Almighty,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Front door shut, back door too,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
And to come every time you call,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
You made it there somehow,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Like a dog on a chain,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
They lowered him down as a king,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
But I'm pressing on,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Memory, ecstasy,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
But you try with your whole soul,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
This world is ruled by violence,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
With the juice running down my leg,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
I won't have my nature way,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
And she makes love just like a woman,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
To be so useless and all,
More people kept a-piling on,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
I bless the day I found you,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
I ain't looking to block you up,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Heart of mine,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
They say that every man must fall,
I long to see you in the morning light,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Maybe when we both get sober,
And she'll be coming forth,
Give you my money, honey,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Ooh, watered-down love,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Like a rolling stone,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I just don't see why I should even care,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Trouble,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
You can run down to the desert,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Never did feel this way before,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
But something has changed,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
You married young just like your ma,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Far away in the stormy night,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
You need something to open your eyes,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
But he can't be blamed,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Well, the way I love that woman,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
They took a clean-cut kid,
I been riding the midnight train,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
But the bottles are done,
The human mind can only stand so much,
A question in your nerves is lit,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Look out, kid,
Gonna serve somebody,
I want you,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I'm going down the river,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
My existence led by confusion boats,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
The country music station plays soft,
That five walls cannot hide him,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Father of cold and father of heat,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
They––they show me to the door,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
And the whole world is on your case,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Don't steal, don't lift,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Drifting too far from shore,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
They say every man needs protection,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I'd already gone the distance,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
I fell down to my bended knees,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
So unknown,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
As his youth now unfolds,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Broken switches, broken gates,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
You wanna drown love,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Hazel, you called and I came,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Nothing was delivered,
Carry the New York Times,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Well, I'm so glad,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
If today was not a crooked highway,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
But you're doing it again,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Only one thing I did wrong,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
And comes to a permanent stop,
The air is getting hotter,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
To a solid rock,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Read books, repeat quotations,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Beyond here lies nothing,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
God knows it's true,
Said I'm pressing on,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Judge and jury took their stand,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Someone to close his heart,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Each time we meet, love,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
They say everything can be replaced,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Like as not, it's better so,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
I want you so bad,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
To be out on your own,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Father of night, father of day,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Keep a clean nose,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
He got that soft, silky skin,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Serve somebody,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
And it's like I ain't here,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
You want watered-down love,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
It's alright,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
The carpet too is moving under you,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
There she come, now, down my way,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
It don't matter what you did,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
The night would see me wide awake,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
People going down to the ground,
If'n you don't know by now,
It's a price I have to pay,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
And you make love just like a woman,
In the end,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Watching the river flow,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
It's too bad he had to go,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
They run a brick and tile company,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
If she ain't feeling well,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
I need a shot of love,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
You're beautiful to me,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
I went into the city, went into the town,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
I've been in and out of happiness,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Well, get sick, get well,
"Come along and take a trip,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Loyalty, unity,
Each one playing a horn,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
If you can't quit your sinning,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
I can't be good, baby,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Resent him to the bone,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
But it ain't him to blame,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Made of silver or of golden,
With his candle lit into the sun,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
He's not selling any alibis,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
That can do what's a-never been done,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
But now morning is clear,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
From their fates try to resign,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
They tell me every man must fall,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Ye shall be a-changed,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
To be alone with you,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Icicles hanging down,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
The night passed away so quickly,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
And the point is slick,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
I got a bird that whistles,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Father of air and father of trees,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
It was from her ship sailing,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Most of the time it's well understood,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Tell me that you love me only,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Don't let me drift too far,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Pressing on,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
And give him back the time he's done,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
How he died nobody could say,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
No, nothing was delivered,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
In the great unknown,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I been good,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Grandpa died last week,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
For something that he never done,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Stone you when you are young and able,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Why she did go,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
They pass by so silently,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
God knows it's outta sight,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
My dear, sweet friend,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Don't follow leaders,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Ever since I been a child,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Eh, in somebody's room,
For her to arrive,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Day you quit me, baby,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Winter would have no spring,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Oh, Angelina,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
And rivers that ran through every day,
When you think that you've lost everything,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
In the instant that I preach,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
And your streets are getting empty,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
And not going through any great extreme,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
That's where you belong --
Democracy don't rule the world --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
But I would never do you wrong.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
At my window with a broken wing.
Until I threw it all away.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
I don't know.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
My love, she speaks softly.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Or put up against the wall.
Going through all these things twice.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
With the glory that is to be.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
And every window made of glass.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
And keep away from pranks.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
They don't make nothing here no more.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
They got – all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Crying out that he been framed.
With your golden loom.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
I got nothing left to burn.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
I want you.
All because his face was brown.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
It don't matter, anyhow.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Lay your hand upon my head.
You're my honey.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
Join the army if you fail.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.

Smoking a cheap cigar.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.

I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.

I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.

The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Leave at your own chosen speed.

To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.

A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
And discovered her invisible self.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Someone I really could care for.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.

The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Never been so easy or so slow.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.

That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
That number eleven was closing.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.

But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.

Some speak of the future.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Nobility, humility.
About an old man that never done wrong.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
My baby told me I would have to go.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
I just can't see through it anymore.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".

I think this time we should escape.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
It runs both cold and deep.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Waiting on my burying ground.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.

Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Just like so many times before.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
I always thought that he was well.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Everything is gonna be fine.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Good as I been to you.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
And tapestry of rhyme.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.

And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
So, darling, you better come through.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
Is just equality in school.
Just remember that death is not the end.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Now they say it's the land of money.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
And it is time for me to slide.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Honey, I never would have come.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Honey, I want you.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Where teardrops fall.
You're a big girl all the way.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
You shouldn't take it so personal.
If'n you don't know by now.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Got ice water in my veins.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
He gone north for a while.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
Billy, you been running for so long.
That must be what it's all about.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
Hope you're ready.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
And I've never been too impressed.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Six by six...
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Friends with you.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
But you're back where you belong.
Rain would gather too.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Need that woman straight and true.
I just can't keep from crying.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
In the night the price was paid.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
It hurts me, too.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
I'm going where I never been before.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
I remember her whispering yet.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
We were the wrong side.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
In an oil refinery.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
The same as my father before him.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
All because of the color of his skin.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
And you only got ten.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
You break your promise all over the place.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
I'm a poet, I know it.
Come over here from over there, girl.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
My baby took my heart from me.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
The time and the place that we'd part.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Going, going, gone.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Drink up your blood like wine.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Saying wants company.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
He ain't-a got no name.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
And he was a friend of mine.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
I can't shoot them anymore.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
You to me were the best.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
As if a wedding vow.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
New morning.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Tangled up in blue.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
The light I never knowed.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Come on, baby.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
In the border-towns of despair.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Right now I'm having trouble.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Honey, come and see about me.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
To anything I might have tried.
I used to care, but things have changed.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Lord, protect my child.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
And time is beginning to crawl.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
And crime don't have a face.
Everybody that was hanging out.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Going back where we come from.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
If you just let me follow you down.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Go lightly on the ground.
Hmm.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
See that my grave is kept clean.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Come on, darling.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
But simply because it's true.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Rain would gather, too.
But she had some way of finding them out.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Under the midnight moon.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
That brave and devoted band.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Everybody's having them dreams.
They would not let me be.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
If not for you.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
In my Cadillac.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Who says she knows me well.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Without this love that we call ours.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
I can't see through it anymore.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
And laid his life on the line.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
You're a big girl now.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
And your golden loom.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Mary wore three links of chain.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Everything is broken.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.

He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.

Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.

Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.

If I ride back again.

I just wanna thank You, Lord.
And I need you, yeah.

When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.

But I was raised on the other.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
Soft as music, light as spring.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
Headed out for the western skies.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
From my toes up to my ears.
If you just let me come home with you.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.

Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
And they gotta cut something.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Oh, got my mind made up.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.

What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

To find that the judge had never spoken.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.

Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.

We may not make it through the night.

Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.

The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Everybody must get stoned.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.

Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.

You won't get it for money.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.

He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.

At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.

On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
To know which way the wind blows.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.

"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.

A man named Martin Luther King...
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.

Never will want for money.
Baby, baby...
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
Without ideals or violence.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.

The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.

And make promises by the hours.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.

Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
I couldn't find any.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Memories of what used to be.

It sure feels right on a night like this.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.

Wanna thank You, Lord.
And I'll go last.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.

Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Serve somebody:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
His epitaph plain:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Yeah, serve somebody:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
But there's one promise, darling:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Till I come into New York town:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
So many things that we never will undo;
Crumble into one another;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Make promises by the hour;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
I find complete love;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
All lies and jest;
Had to be held down by big police;
Some speak of the future;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;

Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Why would I want to take your life?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
How many black cats crossed their trail?

Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Baby, can't you tell?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Am I ready?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?

Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Have they missed you?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
How many compared to yesterday?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Where did you hide your halo?
Gal, where you been so long?
Oh, how could you refuse?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Before it's washed to the sea?
And one deserving of affection?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Before you call him a man?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Poor boy, where you been?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
What's wrong with you this time?
Does he change the course of rivers?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
To love and follow His direction?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
For all these earthly things?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
By golly, what more can I say?
How could they let you go?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
When did you leave heaven?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
What would life be?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
And how does it feel?
What can I give to You?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Just like a rolling stone?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Are you the same person that was here before?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Where did you lose your wings?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Why and what's the reason for?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
How many more can they afford?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
How much poison did they inhale?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
That too many people have died?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
How many more without any reward?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Before they're allowed to be free?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
What good am I?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Before he can hear people cry?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
How can I live for You?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Across the swamp of time?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Too many people have died?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Before they're forever banned?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Before he can see the sky?
When he's standing in front of you?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Baby, what more can I tell?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Like a rolling stone?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Can you get back in?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
How can you say he will haunt you?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
How could they ever mistake you?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
How's everything in heaven?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
What else can a poor boy do?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Must everybody bow?
How does it feel?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What can I do for You?
Across the swooping plain?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Has anybody seen my love?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Are you ready?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Oh, so why not you and me?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
But am I still dreaming yet?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Does anyone even try?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Can I come home with you?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Of everything you see?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
You have to pay to get outta
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
As I stand upon the sand
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Silvio, silver and gold
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Maybe someday you will understand
So I'll make my stand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
And those whom doom and death had spared
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
We live in a political world
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Now you don't seem so proud
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Then came the warning that was before the flood
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Now, a very great man once said
Either from the mountains of Madrid
But something has changed
For what you sold that's not been received
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
By no special friend
I'll always thank the Lord
Nothing was delivered
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
To see him obviously framed
Just what you had in mind
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Many times I've often prayed
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Now you don't act so––so proud
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
I will not go down under the ground
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
He wagged his tail and shook his head
He was a clean-cut kid
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
But she ain't gonna find the road
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Things would be different the next time we wed
And things would be different the next time we wed
Somebody seen him hanging around
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
All the sweethearts you can hold
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
And then you told me later as I apologized
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
And that even the nobles get properly handled
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
I run right home and I went to bed
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
And into the path you are hurled
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
It's something you did
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Roving gambler, he was very bored
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
Now, whenever I get up and
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
She let go of my hand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I've been walking around
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
How many times can a man turn his head
But now something has changed
There ain't nothing in this world
"Equality". I spoke the word
While some, on principles baptized
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Standing on the water, casting your bread
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
I thought that it was well-understood
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
You try so hard, but you don't understand
They took a clean-cut kid
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
You used to be so amused
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
You used––be so proud
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
I live in another world
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
And your trouble is you know it too good
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
I want you, baby, just to understand
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Its iron claws attached
I been wondering all about me
And I ain't complaining none
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
She knows there's no success like failure
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Knows there's no success like failure
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
It's getting dark, too dark to see
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Where I could watch her waltz for free
It's all new to me
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Among the lovely people living free
Limited in sex they dare
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Should I put them by your gate
Mona tried to tell me
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
A girl who would murder her own, true love
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
If dogs run free, why not we
If dogs run free, then what must be
As he rises to fame
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
I'm ready for to fade
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
There were times when I was so lonesome
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
But I can't say I sympathize
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
"Oh, father, you will surely die
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
You smiling through the fence at me
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Should I leave them by your gate
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
A bed that is never mine
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Taking care of somebody nice
When Reilly's daughter got a message
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
On the rising curve
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
"That I might be gone a long, old time
You're not free to belong to me
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Says it's closing time
So, I called up the operator of time
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
From all the plans they do pursue
And never sat once at the head of the table
Waiting to find out what price
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
You said you'd never compromise
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
It'll be with me unto the grave
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
The man the authorities came to blame
What's probably got you baffled more
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
To give the special one you seek a chance
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
I'm sure you're the one to blame
If dogs run free, why not me
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
The crashing waves roll over me
But I feel nothing for their game
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
You into thinking you're the one
You cut to the core
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
When I'm all alone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Better stay away from those
While them that defend what they cannot see
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
You just pick anyone
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Just pick anyone
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
All I feel is heat and flame
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
You say you're looking for someone
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
When the rain is blowing in your face
And suddenly there appeared before me
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
When the roses fade
I am homeless, come and take me
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
You know, it's not even safe no more
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
But the dark does die
I rode with him in a taxi once
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
From the Golden Gate Bridge
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
So I look like a walking mountain range
Hunger pays a heavy price
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
I do declare
And you see why it's so unique to be
Just what you will say when you get home
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Though its shadow's metal badge
Lies that life is black-and-white
And I'm just the same as anyone else
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Up into some paradise
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
The cause was there before we came
Full of hope and desire
What good am I then to others and me
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
And the Negro's name
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I don't even notice she gone
"It's only you that he does crave
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
I can survive and I can endure
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
She plunged him into well water where
And plenty time for good romance
How was I to know you'd be the one
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
So up she picked her babies three
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
That she's the same one
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
He'll see by his grave
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
What about that millionaire
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
So I remember every face
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Little did I realize
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
They say don't come back no more
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Remember me to one who lives there
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
From the start by the rule
We see this empty cage now corrode
How many ears must one man have
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
With all memory and fate
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
And her silver-studded phantom cause
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
To show you something you seen before
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
And I would send a message
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Well, it's all new to me
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Remember me to the one who lives there
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
What you're gonna say when you get home
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
She been gone
At dawn my lover comes to me
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
You could almost think that you're seeing double
But I can get another one
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Oh, trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
'Cause the battle outside raging
Where the time and the tempo drag
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Deceived me into thinking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
For your weary toes to be touching
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
She rode by night and came by morning
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
There's nothing in here moving
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And there's no telling who that it's naming
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
If I was with her too long
What am I saying? What am I knowing
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
You left me standing in the doorway crying
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
The order is a-rapidly fading
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
But then a whistle will be blowing
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
For your weary toes to be a-touching
They're drinking up and walking
Early in the morning, early in the morning
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
The battle outside raging
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
I know that you know that I know that you show something
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
The order is rapidly fading
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Beyond here lies nothing
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
It's not a bad way to make a living
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
And how I know I'll make it through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Look out, the saints are coming through
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Then she told us how times were tough
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
You go north and you go south
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I have fallen far beneath
Make everything from toy guns that spark
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
You turn around to take a final peek
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Her voice once and talk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
But they caught him and they brought him back
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Shoot in the back
I wish she'd unlock
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
The man in me will do nearly any task
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Well, there ain't no going back
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
A girl by the whirlpool
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
As the last fire-truck from hell
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
He's taught in his school
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
They ask me how I feel
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
I chased me a woman up the hill
Ring bar, hard to tell
How many seas must the white dove sail
And if my love is real
Soul to soul our shadows roll
A-how does it feel
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
How many seas must a white dove sail
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Oh, how does it feel
Then why don't she tell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Ring bell, hard to tell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
All and all can only fall
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
He's sure got a lot of gall
How does it feel
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Well, if I die on top of the hill
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Muttering small talk at the wall
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
"For you cannot relive them
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Two eyes took the aim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And remain as I am
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But I can hear another drum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
So, one morning when the sun was warm
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
You better not chew gum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
And there's no exit in any direction
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
But me, I expected it to happen
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
The ones that jump on the wagon
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
That long, black train is pulling on down
From heights that they could not gain
Nothing we can call our own
And she wakes just like a woman
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
My love, she's like some raven
A-she takes just like a woman
You need something to make it known
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Yes, and someone must explain
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
How can the life of such a man
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Well, I'm hanging on
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
And all their daughters put me down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
I figure maybe we're even
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Advertising signs that con
She takes just like a woman
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
The next morning she had awoken
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
For the loser now will be later to win
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
But the second mom was with the seventh son
That long, black train is pulling down
He got that fortress on the mountain
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
She said that all the railroad men
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
But all their daughters put me down
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Why did you trade heaven
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
For the loser now might be later to win
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
There was little to say, there was no conversation
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
But the second mother was with the seventh son
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
But the post office has been stolen
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Their religion of the little ten women
"Not me," said the gambling man
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Somebody new to beat on
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Out of the shower comes a football man
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
She got such a sweet disposition
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
To my knowledge there's just one man
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Must meet the dawn
Yet I swear I see my reflection
All lay down their bandanas and complain
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
I'll be waiting at the station
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
But it's hard to think on
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
As they rode him in custody down to the station
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Have died in battle or in vain
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Will not be understood as they're spoken
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
How many roads must a man walk down
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
And she aches just like a woman
In the pigpen
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
And the corner sign
You don't need a weatherman
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Well, you fake just like a woman
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
To remember the times when I was your only man
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Suicide remarks are torn
Darkness at the break of noon
And the smell of their roses does not remain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
All their daughters put me down
And you ache a-just like a woman
Trying to get a lead on
Guns and clubs followed him down
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
But I swear I see my reflection
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
As you sit on the box you keep him in
You take just like a woman
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
All I'd like you to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
There is a place you go
Silvio, I gotta go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Every place I wanna go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
All I really wanna do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
There's nothing you can say or do
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
I walked down there and ended up
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
How many times must a man look up
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The man in the coon-skin cap
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Man in the coon-skin cap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
What good am I while you softly weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Aladdin and his lamp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
So, don't fear if you hear
Never no more do I wonder
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
When only you are near
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
I don't have to go far
All you boys better run for cover
Alone you stand with nobody near
I say, "Why you say that for
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
I could feel a whole lot better
The lover who has just walked out your door
For I am married to a house carpenter
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
The face of God will appear
She took him by his long, yellow hair
For all eternity I think I will remember
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
At any moment you could go under
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Still I've always kind of missed her
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I close my eyes and I wonder
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The wind howls like a hammer
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Who came here from Cuba's door
Still I say her love-words over
When you whispered in my ear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
In one I was running and in another
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
My ship is in the harbor
You heard me saying a prayer for
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
But morning is clear
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
And I don't even think about her
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Mama, you know, awaits the news
And the princess and the prince discuss
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
At times I think there are no words
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
And then complains
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I try to tell it like it is
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
To sharpen the senses
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Thinking of a series of dreams
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Don't wear sandals
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Wants eleven dollar bills
Her window's wide open, African trees
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
You should be made to wear earphones
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Six-time losers
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
And your father, to your sister he explains
And tells me of her dreams
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
You been hurt so many times
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
People carry roses
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
True love can make a blade of grass
And inside it with the people made of molasses
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
You know that he has no intentions
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
As friends and other strangers
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And I try to harmonize with songs
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Six-time users
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
We living in times when men commit crimes
He's not selling any alibis
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
To memorizing politics
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Statues made of matchsticks
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
But still remains
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
On the back of the fish truck that loads
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Girl by the whirlpool's
You can fall down on your knees
And so Patty calls the cops
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
The empty-handed painter from your streets
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
I let it slip gladly to my friends
The cowboy angel rides
Don't follow leaders
Well, the ragman draws circles
Glide across the lonely years
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
I'd gladly confess
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
I was thinking of a series of dreams
How many deaths will it take till he knows
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
But, though the masters make the rules
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
I'm gonna let you pass
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
With a fantastic collection of stamps
They whisper in the wings
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You never turned around to see the frowns
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And the poor white remains
Good and bad, I define these terms
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Romantic facts of musketeers
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Now, you must provide some answers
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
People on the platforms
That it's you and no one else that owns
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
When your mother sends back all your invitations
What good am I if I say foolish things
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Seven days
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And, though the masters make the rules
With a big bouquet of the roses
To the cutting of fences
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And the first one now will later be last
But, if the arrow is straight
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
They tell me revenge is sweet
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
He really wasn't where it's at
I got into the driver's seat
She seems too far out
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Everyone still talks about
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
I'm moving after midnight
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
By the way, that's a cute hat
Johnny's in the basement
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Someday, everything is gonna be different
One more night the moon is shining bright
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
He built a fire on Main Street
It don't take too long to find out
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
You used to laugh–make fun about
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Ain't it hard when you discover that
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Without any doubt
The slow one now will later be fast
Yet you know there is no answer fit
That might be all that you got
We can hold up a toast if we meet
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Wait for the morning light
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
To keep it in your mind and not forget
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Plants in the bed, but
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
In the precious winds they rot
You don't forget
They tell me to be discreet
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Keep it in your mind and not forget
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
I think that it's best
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
I'm on the pavement
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
How many years can some people exist
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Everything is always right
And, since my feet are now fast
With your pockets well protected at last
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And I, in my armor, turning about
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
In the stillness of the midnight
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
To hold each other tight
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
How many years can a mountain exist
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Keep me set apart
The slowest now will later be fast
You are there in the flickering light
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
But, then again, there's only one I've met
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You're hearing my heart beat
Well, early in the morning till late at night
So he never thinks straight
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
There's some people that
One more night I will wait for the light
You're gonna get hit
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
I soon get some rest
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
You used to laugh about
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Well, I finally started thinking straight
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Talking that the heat put
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
To be alone with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I just might have to come see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
And I tell this truth to you
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Don't it always a-go to show
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Yes, I'd sure like to know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
He been living there three years now
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
With only you in view
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Don't it always go to show
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
The only one I know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Well, I'd sure like to know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
I'd sure like to know
It only goes to show
Sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
But sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Down every street there's a window
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
And for His love they took His life away
Well, I saw it advertised one day
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
The same thing I would want today
We banged the drum slowly
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
I did not do it harmfully
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
And the only tune my guitar could play
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
If I don't take the chance to try
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
But you can never steal away
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
And the ladies treat me kindly
She knocked upon it anyway
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Don't you tell Henry
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
But I can't deny
Spouted out that liberty
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
She starts to speak, but he walks away
And it's up to you to say
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
So, I'm walking down your highway
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
She puts it to me plain as day
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
So I run down most hurriedly
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
For them that think death's honesty
From phony jealousy
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Is worth more than I could pay
No, you'll not now or no other day
So they took him to the infirmary
That I done it the way
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
And that which you've given me today
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
The Spanish-American War had its day
For them that think death––death's honesty
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Maggie says that many say
To those condemned to act accordingly
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
That I was just a puppet in a play
My mind weaves a symphony
My ears hear a symphony
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Or if you just want some company
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
She smiles, walks the other way
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
I send you all my money
How many times must the cannon balls fly
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Went to the doctor the very next day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
But I wish there was something you would do or say
For them that must obey authority
Though I'd never say
A cock is crowing far away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Disconnect these cables––
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Turn, turn, turn again –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
How badly they were shocked –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
First degree and second degree –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
As suicide remarks are torn –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
You will not hear a laugh –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
I a-hope you can hear––
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Haven't seen her since that night –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Hang out the whole next day –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I got no idea what I want –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
I hope that you can hear––
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Havanagee–luh–
Seven more years I longed to have her –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Ten thousand miles or more –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
To know where you are –
Ha–va–
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
I'm sure it was not three –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Havana–gee–
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
With notions his canoe was laden –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Leave all the children home –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Hava–na–
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Private reasons – great or small –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Indians camp along her border –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
I long to hold you in the night –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Oh, my–
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
