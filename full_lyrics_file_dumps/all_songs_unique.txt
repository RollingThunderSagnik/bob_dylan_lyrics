Pale face fit into place, oh, please!

He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!

Oh, yeah!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
But we were tangled up in blue."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Have it on Highway 61."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I can't find my knees."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
We'll both go off together."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I'll endow them onto thee."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
They look as white as snow."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
I would want again tomorrow."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
And it's all for the love of thee."
That you must always first forgive them."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Where you and I will unite."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
It's all for the love of thee."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"Is it easy to forget?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
And pretend that you never have met."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
We want folksingers here."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
"That way down Highway 61."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
And hung on a willow tree."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
For that reason I will have to stay."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Will mourn for your return."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Come flowing down so free?"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I didn't see you around."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
So write to her tenderly."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
You can't blame us at all."
"Have you seen dignity?"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
But I know what you want."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
They look as dark as night."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Would kill a little bird like me."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
You can't blame me at all."
Country'll grow."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
I'll bring back my lady."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Tangled up in blue."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
I'll see her soon, I know."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
God said, "On Highway 61."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
And punched my cigarette."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
And have it on Highway 61."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
You must know about my debutante."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
And keep him good company."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
We'll both go home together."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
You and I'll never know."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
I love far better than thee."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
You can run down to the desert,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
And I'm in the shade,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Try to be a success,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Don't steal, don't lift,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Yes, I want you so bad,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Stand up straight and tall,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
One more night the stars are in sight,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Heart of mine, be still,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
You could look at it and weep,
We take great delight in our own company,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Serve somebody,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
May be living in another country under another name,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
They say every man must need protection,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
And I'm just like that bird,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
True love, they've been without it,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Now you don't talk so loud,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Broken idols, broken heads,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
My senses have been stripped,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
A true love of mine,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
God knows it's terrifying,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
I try my best to be just like I am,
I once held her in my arms,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
She would have married me,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The sky too is folding over you,
How does it feel,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
To hang and to lynch,
That her father was going to hang,
Get born, keep warm,
Ten thousand men on the move,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
I got my mind made up,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Name of Martin Luther King,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Don't put yourself over the line,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Analyze you, categorize you,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
To be without a home,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Mercury, gravity,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
You broke a heart that loved you,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
A dream about you, baby,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
And rivers that ran through every day,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
May be an actor in a plot,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
You to me were true,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
I got two white horses following me,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Without ideals or violence,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
I like the cool way you look at me,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
"Not I," said the referee,
Three angels up above the street,
But he's the property of Jesus,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
But it would not be new,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Don't let her see where you're going,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
All I really wanna do,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Tears on the letter that I write,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Thank You, Lord,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
God knows there's a chance,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Vanished from my hand,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
From their fates try to resign,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
The man in the trench-coat,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Just don't know what to do,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I thank the Lord,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Holding his club like he was a king,
You need something to open your eyes,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Can't find what I need,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
See you fly or watch you die,
Dust on my face and my cape,
That fellow who never blushes,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
And I'm so glad,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
The light I never knowed,
Get back, write Braille,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Each one playing a horn,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
People talk over situations,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
If not for you,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
They say every man needs protection,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
But, it ain't me, babe,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Don't let her know,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Relationships of ownership,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
In his anger and his shame,
I threw it all away,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Front door shut, back door too,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
To be alone with you,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Hmm, I can make it through,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Staying far behind without you,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
All them prophets good and gone,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Father of air and father of trees,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Why she did go,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
I march in the parade of liberty,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
To hide 'neath a hood,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
You have laid down Your life for me,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
You had enough of hatred,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Six months on the chain gang,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Never did feel this way before,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Face full of black soot,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Take the motherless children off the street,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
You got to serve somebody,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Waiting for the trains,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Heart of mine, go back home,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
And may you stay forever young,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I can change, I swear,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Don't let her know that you love her,
God don't call it wrong,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Ye shall be a-changed,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
And, if I see the day,
Out to the windy beach,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Go away from my window,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Each time we meet, love,
When God and man will be reconciled,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Stripping away at it all,
Till both of us fell by the way,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Every moon is so sanctified,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Well, I'm so glad,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
I been good,
Private reasons, great or small,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Go melt back in the night,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
One by one they follow the sun,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
I want you so bad,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Human gods aim for their mark,
God knows it's true,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Look who's back in town,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Just then the order came to charge,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
She got great big hind legs,
In the lonely night,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Nothing was delivered,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Seem like I been down this way before,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
If anything is gonna sell,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
I'm so glad,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
You better chew gum,
The day would surely have to break,
I'm going out of my mind,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Going home,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Resent him to the bone,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Baby, please stop crying,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
You always responded when I needed your help,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
We'll go someplace unknown,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Father of night, father of day,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Carry the New York Times,
Grandpa died last week,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
My hands didn't touch him none,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
But evidently she don't,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
In the great unknown,
We've killed each one,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
You've got to serve somebody,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Watch the river flow,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
God knows it's fragile,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
If ever I prove false to you,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
But now morning is clear,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Looking for a new fool,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
If she ain't feeling well,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
To be out on your own,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
While riding on a train going west,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
He is centuries old,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Made before the foundation of the world,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
They––they show me to the door,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
I had no one for to go my bail,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
The carpet too is moving under you,
God knows it's a crime,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
How he died nobody could say,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Stone you just like they said they would,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I'll be on my way,
You can raise up your right hand,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
To know how much I really care,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
With what your fate is going to be,
Come all without, come all within,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Don't ever try to change me,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Father of day, father of night,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
The winter would hold no spring,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
If you must cling to someone,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Want you so bad,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
To shine in through,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Is it really any wonder,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
There she come, now, down my way,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
That foreign sound in your ear,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I would not feel so all alone,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Eh, see what you can do,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
You have given everything to me,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
That you'd have liked me to,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Eh, singing just for you,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
In the turning of twilight,
Carved next to his name,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I rambled out of New York town,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
The only son of God Almighty,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Don't wear sandals,
They tell me every man must fall,
It was from her ship sailing,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
She said she would always stay,
At ships with tattooed sails,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
First to come in was the flying moth,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Made of silver or of golden,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
You made it there somehow,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I can't understand,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
China doll, alcohol,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
But he can't be blamed,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
That the laws are with him,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
For she ain't the same,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Ain't no going back,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Thieving in the alley,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Searching everywhere I know,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Well, get sick, get well,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
The night passed away so quickly,
I been riding the midnight train,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
I should have left this town this morning,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
And joined the John Birch Society,
In the hills of mystery,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
That they do not respect in any degree,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And give him back the time he's done,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
People going down to the ground,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
But you're doing it again,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
At the close of the day,
Wintertime in New York town,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Far away and over the wall,
With the juice running down my leg,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Day you quit me, baby,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
I'm gonna let you pass,
They say every man need protection,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
The air is getting hotter,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Trouble,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
I'm leaving today,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Says he's got a bad bill,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Paradise, sacrifice,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
The beat is pumping,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Never weak, but always strong,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Advertising signs, they con,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Dream about you, baby,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
If you throw it all away,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
More people kept a-piling on,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Don't follow leaders,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Get dressed, get blessed,
And pretend that we never have touched,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Heart of mine,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
When I was in Missouri,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
A thousand miles from home,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
They must bust in early May,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
To be so useless and all,
Like some mystery,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Don't let her hear,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
It always means so much,
To be on your own,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
I just keep pressing on,
And she'll be coming forth,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
And the sooner you come up with them,
As his youth now unfolds,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
To be––direction home,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
And there's two white horses following me,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Going, going, gone,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
You have explained every mystery,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
The Second World War came to an end,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
God knows that, when you see it,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Going,
The kingdoms of experience,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
And the point is slick,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
And I'm back in the rain,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Stone you and say good luck,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
In love and with kindness,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Well, I been gambling so long,
I long to see you in the morning light,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
In the darkness of my night,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
They keep it all hid,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
But, to remain as friends,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Father of time and father of dreams,
In the end,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Everything's a-hers or his,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
I'll go see them come down my way,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Give you my money, honey,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Since you've been gone,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
God knows there's a purpose,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Socialism, hypnotism,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Far away in the stormy night,
Where I will always be renewed,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
You wanna drown love,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
To gather flowers constantly,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
And, if I can save you any time,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
I just don't know what to do,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
And, on their promises of paradise,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Fare thee well but for a while,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Well, I may just swear,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Strangers all give me the news,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Just like I did before,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Gonna serve somebody,
And think they're fooling you,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
And you take just like a woman,
God knows there's a river,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
He been around the world and back again,
You'll be doing society a favor,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
I know I can't win,
Better jump down the manhole,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Stay away from the train line,
Madams light the candles,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
The one we can see and can feel,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
The night would see me wide awake,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
But, if you want me to,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
People talk of situations,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Like a complete unknown,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
And, though the line is cut,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Hang around the ink-well,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
The country doctor rambles,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
And ye shall be a-changed,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
And on the highway of regret,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
By users, cheaters,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Precious father, loving mother,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
But the bottles are done,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Read books, repeat quotations,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Speaking to some French girl,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
The joint is jumping,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
By rivers of blindness,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
I can see the turning of the key,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
God knows everything,
In the instant that I preach,
True love of mine,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
New morning,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
I won't have my nature way,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Light yourself a candle,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
And come every time you call,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
But, if I will save you the time,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Joey, Joey,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
As the daylight hours do increase,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Judge and jury took their stand,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
If today was not a crooked highway,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Said I'm pressing on,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
You have given me life to live,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Going, going,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Under the microscope,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
They say every man must fall,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
It's rising up above my head,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
On the stone that remains,
To protect his white skin,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
When the night comes falling,
Loyalty, unity,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Of this I can't say very much,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
They don't believe in mercy,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I tried to reach you, honey,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Somewhere down the road some day,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
A man with a badge skips by,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
I have no one to meet,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
And point away from the past,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
I found my world, found my world in you,
If I didn't have to guess,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Ye shall be changed,
To find out if she's talked,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
I fell down to my bended knees,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Love don't have any place,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
But, if I can save you any time,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
I been good while I been waiting,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
This world is ruled by violence,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I got the worried blues,
Or have done something wrong,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
First degree and second degree,
The night blows cold and rainy,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Keep me where you are,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
You have given me eyes to see,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
She once was a true love of mine,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Someone to close his heart,
Want you,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I got those worried blues,
One by one until there were none,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Already the fiesta has begun,
For her to arrive,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Don't let her see that you need her,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
By losers, cheaters,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
You follow, find yourself at war,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Oh, see what you can do,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I'd be sad and blue,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
When I seen him lose control,
It always has hit me from below,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Saved,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
She'll surely turn to white,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Every head is so dignified,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
I couldn't see where we were going,
On this new morning, new morning,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
But, deep inside my heart,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Mixing up the medicine,
I got no place left to turn,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
And pay the price and not take your advice,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
And it's like I ain't here,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Look out, kid,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Keep a clean nose,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
For all intended purposes,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Memory, ecstasy,
The train leaves at half past ten,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
And it ain't me, babe,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Or select you or dissect you,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
And to come every time you call,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
It all seemed so well-timed,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
My limbs are shaking,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
That long, black train is pulling down,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
No direction home,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
In one the surface was frozen,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
I landed up on the downtown side,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
In a pine box for all eternity,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
For his age he is wise,
But I would not feel so all alone,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And forget my pride,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
But I've been hanging on,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Over your senses you have no control,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
And, if anybody asks me,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Says he's got a bad cough,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Watered-down love,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Laying low,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I never can go because, you know,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
A handle hid out in the dark,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Well, well, well,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
To stay closer than any friend,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Far past the frozen leaves,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
In the little church a-this side of town,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
You were snow, you were rain,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Too serious to fool,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Well, I can't understand,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
They say everything can be replaced,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
As the present now will later be past,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Up and down the block,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
I can make it through,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Where mercy walks the plank,
But I'm saved,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
It still ain't me, babe,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Icicles hanging down,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
And she aches just like a woman,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
And not going through any great extreme,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
It's alright,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
But you were gambling for support,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Well, the job that you used to have,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
I went down where the vultures feed,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Bring the wife and family,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Alright, I'm so glad,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
She never does me wrong,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
So, never leave me lonely,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Just like a rolling stone,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
That fired the gun,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
I need a shot of love,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
To be one your own,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
It hurts me, too,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
I get my sweet reward,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
It's not aimed at anyone,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
They lowered him down as a king,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
And to come each time you call,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I'm going back to Colorado,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Don't let yourself stumble,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
In the shadows of moonlight,
With a killer's pride, security,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Get jailed, jump bail,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
To your tambourine in time,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
I shall be released,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Try hard, get barred,
So glad,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
My love, she speaks softly,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
And also by his feet,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
You got something I want plenty of,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
That five walls cannot hide him,
King of the streets, child of clay,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Need a woman all the time,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Nothing too very scientific,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I just say no thanks,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Don't mind the driving rain,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
And your streets are getting empty,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
"Come along and take a trip,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
And ride a horse along the trail,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
And here I sit so patiently,
I've been around this whole country,
We live in a political world,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
God don't call it treason,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
He's not selling any alibis,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Never needed to call you my whore,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
In the image of someone you used to know,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
My woman needs it every day,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Don't try No Doz,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
She leave by the other and roam,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Ever since I been a child,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Broken threads, broken springs,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
God knows there's a heaven,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
When there is no more,
Like as not, it's better so,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
As I travel down life's pathway,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Had no one to go my bail,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
I want my arms around you,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
You stole her love from me one day,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Who will promise never to part,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Using every angle under the sun,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
If you'd see me this a-way,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Love that's pure no accident,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Where the neon madmen climb,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
God knows it's a struggle,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
He's the property of Jesus,
Make you spin or do you in,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
A hand set the spark,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Giving back all of what you owe,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
You say my kisses are not like his,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Of ancient history,
"Not me," said his manager,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
I want you,
Go down to the river, babe,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
They say every distance is not near,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I'd give you the sky high above,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I can't be good, baby,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
They say that every man must fall,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
And I got those worried blues,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Father of cold and father of heat,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
I think we better talk this over,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Cares not to come up any higher,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
It's like I ain't here,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Baby, let me follow you down,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Tell me that you love me only,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
I don't care if you analyze me,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
With his fist in a clinch,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
And I got the worried blues,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
My love, she speaks like silence,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
My dear, sweet friend,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
And furnish me with tape,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
No, nothing was delivered,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
It don't matter what you did,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Who among them would try to impress you,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Precious angel under the sun,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
One by one they followed the sun,
While paupers change possessions,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
It could even be like a myth,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Had a dream about you, baby,
You were striped, you were plain,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
It's too bad he had to go,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Don't matter what you did,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
But I know that he don't talk,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Just to know that you are near,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
I'm never, never far from home,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Don't let yourself fall,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
God knows when,
Oh, watered-down love,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Automobile coming into style,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I don't want to meet your kin,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
You gotta look some other place,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
May you stay forever young,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
For the wise men and the fools,
Every brain is civilized,
And gathering storms may arise,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Tell me,
And it's only that I'm asking,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Don't wanna be a bum,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Not the end, not the end,
You don't have to feed me,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Father of black, father of white,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
And, although that we're single and free,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
I got a bird that whistles,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Corrina, Corrina,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
You need something to open up a new door,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
All the silver, all the gold,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Tell her not to worry,
I went back home, put on my tie,
I'd only have to stay,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
You and me, we had completeness,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
But it ain't him to blame,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Went to the station down in the yard,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
I like the way that you move your hips,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Look away, you rolling river,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
So many roads, so much at stake,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
God knows how to make it flow,
She's opened up a happy home,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
That can do what's a-never been done,
To a solid rock,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Oxford Town around the bend,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
And you know I could never be your own,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Is used, it is plain,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
So I got those worries blues,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
She's the worst you could ever have,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
A complete unknown,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Yet every distance is not near,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
For the politician's gain,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
You even make love just like a woman,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Without your sweet love,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
The sky too is folding under you,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
God knows you've got to weep,
Watching the river flow,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Equality, liberty,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
For something that he never done,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I wish tonight were here,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Don't tie no bows,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Too noble to neglect,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Without a dream in my heart,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Like you never did before,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Like a dog on a chain,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Who could they get to carry you,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Thinking about the government,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
My arms and legs were broken,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
This situation can only get rougher,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Don't let her see,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
She said she would never forget,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
I had so much left to do,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Like a rolling stone,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
The country music station plays soft,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
You're beautiful to me,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Simplify you, classify you,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
God sees it all unfold,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
He's young and on fire,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Don't you tell Henry,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
I bless the day I found you,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Seven days,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Circled by the circus sands,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
But I'm pressing on,
You have given all there is to give,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
You got something better,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
But it ain't me, babe,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
And comes to a permanent stop,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
With no direction home,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Don't let me drift too far,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
It was you who came right through,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
I don't care if you feel like me,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Is looking for a new fool,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
You'll change your last name, too,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Where life and death are memorized,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Beating for the dead that rise,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Puffing on a big cigar,
When she lays upon the grass,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
People carry roses,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Someone to open each and every door,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
I'd already gone the distance,
But you try with your whole soul,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
It's really something,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Forever young, forever young,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Into my own parade,
It's a price I have to pay,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Roll, Willie, roll,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Yes, and I'll go last,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
With his candle lit into the sun,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Oh, singing just for you,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
She'll be coming forth,
A million faces at my feet,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Drifting too far from shore,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
That can do what's never been done,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
To keep up his hate,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
I went into the city, went into the town,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
And played the fife lowly,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Come on, come on, stick together,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
You married young just like your ma,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
To have––be on your own,
You will be alright, girl,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
All the tired horses in the sun,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Friends with you,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
But the time ain't tall,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Trust yourself,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
You want watered-down love,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Went back home to the yard,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Oh, Angelina,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
All you can do is do what you must,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
And all of your children start to resent you,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
That must be what it's all about,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
I try my best to be like I am,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Over the hills and far away,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
And you make love just like a woman,
But something has changed,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
There's always someone who understands,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Badge out, laid off,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
And the whole world is on your case,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
If'n you don't know by now,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
I went into the city, into the town,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
That one doctor cannot save him,
I got a wife and five little children,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
How he died nobody can say,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Got my mind made up,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
If you'd see me this way,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
When all will be well,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Aim well, my little one,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Looking 'bout the government,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
That four ears cannot hear him,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
We'll fly the night away,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I went out last night to take a little round,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
But I will be back, I will survive,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Silhouetted by the sea,
The day you quit me, baby,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Far away from it all,
Searching high, searching low,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
The haunted, frightened trees,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Without a love of my own,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
As human gods aim for their mark,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Spent my money on you, honey,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Don't let me change my heart,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
He won't do nothing to you,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Four by four, no illusion for,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Got me a secret membership card,
Broken lines, broken strings,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
To strict party-platform ties,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Winter would have no spring,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Better jump down a manhole,
I'm going down the river,
So unknown,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
God knows it's outta sight,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Pressing on,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
That's where you belong --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Democracy don't rule the world --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
I got a bird that sings.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Rain would gather, too.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
And laid his life on the line.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Baby, two feet from the well.
In this concrete world full of souls.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Down to New Orleans.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Lay dead beside him there.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
But I was raised on the other.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Ever since I seen you there.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
All my connections too.
Than people who are most content.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
To live it you had to explode.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
Hope that it don't sleet.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Got ice water in my veins.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
What you'll say when you get home.
I just can't keep from crying.
I didn't feel so cold then.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
I can't hear you anymore.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
And your golden loom.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
But I can't get close to her at all.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
She just acts like we never have met.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.

And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I remember her whispering yet.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
I'm younger than that now.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
You won't get it for money.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
The next day could be your last.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
I got nothing left to burn.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
And disregards the rest.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
I's looking around just to see myself.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Find out something only dead men know.
Suffering like a fool.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
And crime don't have a face.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Rode slowly back again.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
To see what kinda words he could say.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.

It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
Look a-the other way.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Know not what the years may hold.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
I had so little time to fail.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
He's always on trial for just being born.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I can't see through it anymore.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
There was nobody around.
I know something is changed.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Feel further away than ever before.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
And she'll only know he's dead.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Going through all these things twice.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.

Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
At the sorority sisters' home.
While I'm in the hall.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Tell me.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
But I know that I can't move.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
It runs both cold and deep.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
You were always so close and still within reach.
It's just the old American way.
And you only got ten.
It was you who understood.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
I'm going where I never been before.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
His mama sure was proud of him.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
You can make it too.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
That can win what's never been won.
Without ideals or violence.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
What looks like the easy way out.
Baby, baby...
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
And the people that confronted him were many.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
I'd give anything to be with you.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
People bending broken rules.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
And come away with me.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
Reality has always had too many heads.
It don't matter, anyhow.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
Everybody must get stoned.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Orders from the D.A.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
For me to return to or chase.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Going, going, gone.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
If you just let me come home with you.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
It hurts me, too.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
When I run outta things to investigate.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Honey, baby.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Slowly into autumn.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Magic in a magical land.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
Honey, I want you.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
And the Santa Fe.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Where I was born and partly raised.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
And the mailbox is locked.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Waiting on my burying ground.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
My love, she speaks softly.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Everybody's having them dreams.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
If it just don't make me hurts.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
But you're not even sure what it is.
Hmm, tell me.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
You're a big girl all the way.
Chain you down or bring you down.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
Crying out that he was framed.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
It don't matter anyhow.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Until I threw it all away.
I hope I'm ready.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Have fallen from her curls.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
Hope you're ready.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
You may not see me tomorrow.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Come on, honey.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
God knows...
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Good car to drive, after a war.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
It sure is right on a night like this.
And get something quick to eat.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
When I'm alone with you.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Come on, darling.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
Leave no stone unturned.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
About an old man that never done wrong.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Of every man who put me here.
See that my grave is kept clean.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Most of the time.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
Lord, protect my child.
Oh, her darling love she found.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
I just can't beg you anymore.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
I got trouble in my mind.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Oh, yes, they did.
I know you always say that you agree.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
But the fighter still remains.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
I can't use it anymore.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
I don't even know why we come.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
And time is beginning to crawl.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Everything is gonna be fine.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Can't see over to the other side.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
I want everybody to be free.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
The words that her lover had said.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
When you go your way and I go mine.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
To know which way the wind blows.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
While evening slips away.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Looking for a new friend.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
And she had left him to die in there.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
Is gonna be against the law.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Oh, Angelina.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
She once was a true love of mine.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
There's a guy I gotta see.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.

The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.

She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Join the army if you fail.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
As the present now will later be past.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
"And stay all night with me.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Evidently she won't.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Hmm.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
That number eleven was closing.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Oh, got my mind made up.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
And rivers that ran through every day.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
And keep away from pranks.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Where teardrops fall.
But you're never sure why you're here.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Crumble into one another.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
I would only let you down.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
But with the country to where you're going.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
That's really and truly an American.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Memories of what used to be.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
You can show me a new place to start.
A true love of mine.
But you break just like a little girl.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
That Johanna's not here.
And ye shall be changed.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Under the hedges.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
So many people I never saw in my life.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
In the summertime when you were with me.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
My face you'll never see no more.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Buildings going up to the sky.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
My love winks, she does not bother.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Gonna serve somebody.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Father of love and father of rain.
Come on, baby...
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
They want me for a gambling fight.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Finalize you or advertise you.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
We all know for sure that it's real.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Sweet lady.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Fighting every inch of the way.
To the sin of love's false security.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
And then unto eternity.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Someone's watching over you.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Oh, convey herself away.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
When he played and we didn't dance.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Everybody that was hanging out.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Drink up your blood like wine.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Just like the time before and the time before that.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
You only got ten.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Who says she knows me well.
I said that.
That's the way I remember her best.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
You'll do as much for me.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
And watch the parking meters.
Behind a man's brain.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
You got it, baby.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
I'd be lost if not for you.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
The National Guard stands around the door.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
To be alone with you.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Never will want for money.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
I couldn't find any.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Lost time is not found again.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Just what he was talking about.
Billy, you been running for so long.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
If'n you don't know by now.
Like you never done before.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
But these to tell what's true.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Thought I was a communist.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
But he sure left here in style.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Some speak of the future.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
With the golden loom.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Never been so easy or so slow.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
It would go up against every rule.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
With your golden loom.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Wants to get it paid off.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
I didn't realize how young you were.
You're too hot, darling.
I think this time we should escape.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
In the palace of the Pope.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
And no time to think.
Using ideas as my maps.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
And that failure's no success at all.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Is just equality in school.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Everything is broken.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I took some comfort there.
All because of the color of his skin.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
At not getting their money's worth.
And I need you, ah.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Honey, come and see about me.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
I never saw the man again.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
'Steada acting like we never met.
I got nothing to go back to now.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Yes, and I'll go last.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Tell me that it isn't true.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
The whole night through.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Gone as the season she's taken.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
The last radio is playing.
Try to avoid the scandals.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.

That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.

Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
They found him dead in the street one day.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Ever since we've been apart.

Hope I don't blow it.
A man named Martin Luther King...
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.

He died on the road, he died on the road.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.

But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.

Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.

To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.

But I can't help falling in love with you.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.

Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.

With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.

And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Under the midnight moon.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.

That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Or put up against the wall.
People sleeping in broken beds.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.

What some people are gonna do for money.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.

I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
And guarded them as they fell.
Or pick it up after he throws it.

Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
And then go on home and have my fun.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
By the jealousy of others around her.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Watch the parking meters.
In the pale moonlight.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.

That last night I was with.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Walking around with no one else.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Go find out something only dead men know.
You always got more than enough rope.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Up and down the lonesome town.

Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Greenwich Village.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
May you stay forever young.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
That's the day you die.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Because everybody must get stoned.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Well, I'm just thumping.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Six by six...
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
I hate bears.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
To anything I mighta tried.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Bid farewell forever.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
I will only let you down.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
No kindred or relative nigh.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Some place so high above the wall.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
And I need you, yeah.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Tried to create a next world war.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Heart of mine.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Even before you came in the door.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
My mind is breaking.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
It can't be this way everywhere.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Need that woman straight and true.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Means another poor boy is underground.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Trust yourself.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Some place so high above this wall.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Someone to open each and every door.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
Just crying out that he was framed.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
When my working day's through.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
And clouds cover up the ground.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
"Get well, get well," said she.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Leading me, going home.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
See like me or be like me.
And ye shall be a-changed.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Without a love of my own.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
Just what this song is all about.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
From my toes up to my ears.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Broken voices on broken phones.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
And make promises by the hours.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
And tapestry of rhyme.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Down along my restless palms.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Figuring a way to get back home.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
I had something to protect.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
In the dark land of the sun.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
You're on the bottom.
My baby took my heart from me.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
I've seen trouble all my days.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
They both rode off together.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
The time and the place that we'd part.
I always thought that he was well.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Drifting too far from shore.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
And light on your right knee.
After losing every battle.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
We may not make it through the night.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Living down Sonora way.
Go lightly on the ground.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
A foreign sound to your ear.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I been in this thing too long.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Just you and me.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
So long, honey babe.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
You're my baby.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
I see better days and I do better things.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
I just go pump on it some.
And the morning will be breaking.
The sooner you can leave.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
You don't want me, give my money back.
He ain't-a got no name.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
By that soft and shining sea.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
And it never seemed strange.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
You got a heart of stone.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
I don't know.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
You want a watered-down love.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Man is opposed to fair play:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Yeah, serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
His epitaph plain:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Till I come into New York town:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Serve somebody:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
But there's one promise, darling:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Some speak of the future;
I find complete love;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Crumble into one another;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Had to be held down by big police;
All lies and jest;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Make promises by the hour;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
<i>What?</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<p>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
What can I do for You?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Before they're allowed to be free?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Before he can see the sky?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Can you get back in?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Where did you hide your halo?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Why and what's the reason for?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Before you call him a man?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
What else can a poor boy do?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
And how does it feel?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Does anyone even try?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
When he's standing in front of you?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
What good am I?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Where did you lose your wings?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
What can I give to You?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
How can I live for You?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Did you respect me for what I did?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Have they missed you?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To love and follow His direction?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Before he can hear people cry?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Of everything you see?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
That too many people have died?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
What's wrong with you this time?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
How many more can they afford?
How many compared to yesterday?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Oh, so why not you and me?
And one deserving of affection?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Before they're forever banned?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Baby, can I come home with you?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
How can you say he will haunt you?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Too many people have died?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
What would life be?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
How does it feel?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Am I ready?
Can I come home with you?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
How's everything in heaven?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Are you ready?
Must everybody bow?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Has anybody seen my love?
By golly, what more can I say?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Are you the same person that was here before?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Baby, can't you tell?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Like a rolling stone?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
For all these earthly things?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
How could they ever mistake you?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Why would I want to take your life?
How many more without any reward?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Does he change the course of rivers?
How could they let you go?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Who's gonna let it roll?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Who killed Davey Moore?
What do you think about that, my friend?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Gal, where you been so long?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Across the swamp of time?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Before it's washed to the sea?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
So I can know if I'm really real?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Across the swooping plain?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
When did you leave heaven?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Just like a rolling stone?
Am I still dreaming yet?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How much poison did they inhale?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
You have to pay to get outta
It was put together down in Argentina
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Now, a very great man once said
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
I want you, baby, just to understand
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
I run right home and I went to bed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Everything stays down where it's wounded
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
I've been walking around
As I stand upon the sand
They took a clean-cut kid
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
But she ain't gonna find the road
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
And things would be different the next time we wed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
I will not go down under the ground
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
She let go of my hand
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Nothing was delivered
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
But now something has changed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And those whom doom and death had spared
So I'll make my stand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
All the sweethearts you can hold
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Silvio, silver and gold
I'll always thank the Lord
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
I had to say something to strike him very weird
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Maybe someday you will understand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Now you don't seem so proud
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
You used to be so amused
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
The changes I was going through can't even be used
"Equality". I spoke the word
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
You used––be so proud
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I live in another world
Many times I've often prayed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Its iron claws attached
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Things would be different the next time we wed
It's something you did
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
There ain't nothing in this world
To see him obviously framed
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
By no special friend
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
And into the path you are hurled
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Then came the warning that was before the flood
He was a clean-cut kid
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
I thought that it was well-understood
While some, on principles baptized
How many times can a man turn his head
We live in a political world
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
And then you told me later as I apologized
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
But all that suffering was not to be compared
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Just what you had in mind
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Now you don't act so––so proud
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, whenever I get up and
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Standing on the water, casting your bread
But something has changed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
For what you sold that's not been received
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Somebody seen him hanging around
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
And your trouble is you know it too good
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Why wait any longer for the one you love
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Should I leave them by your gate
To give the special one you seek a chance
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
"That I might be gone a long, old time
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
They say don't come back no more
So I look like a walking mountain range
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
You said you'd never compromise
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
She plunged him into well water where
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
And the Negro's name
I am homeless, come and take me
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
How was I to know you'd be the one
But I can get another one
If dogs run free, why not we
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
"It's only you that he does crave
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
When the roses fade
And you see why it's so unique to be
And I would send a message
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
You cut to the core
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
But I feel nothing for their game
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
From the start by the rule
Should I put them by your gate
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Just what you will say when you get home
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
A girl who would murder her own, true love
You say you're looking for someone
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
If dogs run free, why not me
It'll be with me unto the grave
While them that defend what they cannot see
And I'm just the same as anyone else
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
That she's the same one
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Remember me to one who lives there
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
But the dark does die
Knows there's no success like failure
Among the lovely people living free
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
And suddenly there appeared before me
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
She been gone
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And that is that one must always flush out his house
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
There were times when I was so lonesome
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
As he rises to fame
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Con you into thinking that you're the one
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
So up she picked her babies three
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
You know, it's not even safe no more
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
From all the plans they do pursue
When the rain is blowing in your face
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
To show you something you seen before
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
We see this empty cage now corrode
Full of hope and desire
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
You into thinking you're the one
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
You're not free to belong to me
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
I'm sure you're the one to blame
I'm ready for to fade
I do declare
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I don't even notice she gone
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
All I feel is heat and flame
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Remember me to the one who lives there
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Well, it's all new to me
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Little did I realize
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Just pick anyone
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Lies that life is black-and-white
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
And her silver-studded phantom cause
A bed that is never mine
Breaking hearts up and down the line
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
On the rising curve
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
I can survive and I can endure
I rode with him in a taxi once
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
So, I called up the operator of time
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
And I ain't complaining none
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
If dogs run free, then what must be
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Better stay away from those
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
It's all new to me
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Mona tried to tell me
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
I been wondering all about me
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Taking care of somebody nice
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
She knows there's no success like failure
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
The cause was there before we came
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Hunger pays a heavy price
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Says it's closing time
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Up into some paradise
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
With all memory and fate
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Everybody's wearing a disguise
He'll see by his grave
What's probably got you baffled more
Waiting to find out what price
From the Golden Gate Bridge
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
The crashing waves roll over me
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
So I remember every face
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Limited in sex they dare
At dawn my lover comes to me
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
But I can't say I sympathize
How many ears must one man have
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
The man the authorities came to blame
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
And plenty time for good romance
What about that millionaire
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And never sat once at the head of the table
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Though its shadow's metal badge
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
What you're gonna say when you get home
You just pick anyone
When I'm all alone
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
What good am I then to others and me
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
'Cause the battle outside raging
And the cards are no good that you're holding
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
You left me standing in the doorway crying
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
She rode by night and came by morning
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Where the time and the tempo drag
The battle outside raging
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
The order is rapidly fading
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
There's nothing in here moving
The order is a-rapidly fading
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
If I was with her too long
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Deceived me into thinking
For your weary toes to be a-touching
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
What am I saying? What am I knowing
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
I know that you know that I know that you show something
But then a whistle will be blowing
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
For your weary toes to be touching
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
They're drinking up and walking
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
It's not a bad way to make a living
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Look out, the saints are coming through
I have fallen far beneath
Then she told us how times were tough
You go north and you go south
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And how I know I'll make it through
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
But they caught him and they brought him back
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Her voice once and talk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Well, there ain't no going back
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Shoot in the back
The man in me will do nearly any task
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
You turn around to take a final peek
I wish she'd unlock
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
I chased me a woman up the hill
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
A-how does it feel
And if my love is real
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Ring bar, hard to tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
As the last fire-truck from hell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
A girl by the whirlpool
Muttering small talk at the wall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
How many seas must the white dove sail
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Then why don't she tell
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Ring bell, hard to tell
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Well, if I die on top of the hill
All and all can only fall
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
How many seas must a white dove sail
Oh, how does it feel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
He's sure got a lot of gall
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
He's taught in his school
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
How does it feel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
They ask me how I feel
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
And remain as I am
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You better not chew gum
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
So, one morning when the sun was warm
"For you cannot relive them
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Two eyes took the aim
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
But I can hear another drum
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
As you sit on the box you keep him in
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
But me, I expected it to happen
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
She got such a sweet disposition
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I figure maybe we're even
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Out of the shower comes a football man
Suicide remarks are torn
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
From heights that they could not gain
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Must meet the dawn
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Somebody new to beat on
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Well, you fake just like a woman
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
The next morning she had awoken
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
You need something to make it known
You don't need a weatherman
Guns and clubs followed him down
Why did you trade heaven
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
The ones that jump on the wagon
I'll be waiting at the station
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Trying to get a lead on
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
And the smell of their roses does not remain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
My love, she's like some raven
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
And the corner sign
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
That long, black train is pulling down
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
But I swear I see my reflection
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
In ceremonies of the horsemen
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
And you ache a-just like a woman
Have died in battle or in vain
She said that all the railroad men
She takes just like a woman
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
For the loser now will be later to win
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
That long, black train is pulling on down
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, I'm hanging on
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
You take just like a woman
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
But it's hard to think on
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
He got that fortress on the mountain
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
"Not me," said the gambling man
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
How many roads must a man walk down
But the second mom was with the seventh son
To my knowledge there's just one man
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
But the post office has been stolen
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
And she wakes just like a woman
Advertising signs that con
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Yes, and someone must explain
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
There was little to say, there was no conversation
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
In the pigpen
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And all their daughters put me down
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
To remember the times when I was your only man
For the loser now might be later to win
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Their religion of the little ten women
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
All their daughters put me down
But all their daughters put me down
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
And she aches just like a woman
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
The foreign sun, it squints upon
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Yet I swear I see my reflection
And there's no exit in any direction
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Darkness at the break of noon
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
A-she takes just like a woman
How can the life of such a man
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All I'd like you to do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Silvio, I gotta go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Every place I wanna go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
There's nothing you can say or do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
All I really wanna do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
There is a place you go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
The man in the coon-skin cap
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Man in the coon-skin cap
What good am I while you softly weep
I walked down there and ended up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
How many times must a man look up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Aladdin and his lamp
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Never no more do I wonder
She took him by his long, yellow hair
The face of God will appear
Alone you stand with nobody near
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I close my eyes and I wonder
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
The wind howls like a hammer
The lover who has just walked out your door
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
All you boys better run for cover
Who came here from Cuba's door
Still I say her love-words over
I don't have to go far
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
You heard me saying a prayer for
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
In one I was running and in another
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
For I am married to a house carpenter
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I say, "Why you say that for
When only you are near
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
So, don't fear if you hear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
At any moment you could go under
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Still I've always kind of missed her
When you whispered in my ear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
But morning is clear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
And I don't even think about her
For all eternity I think I will remember
I could feel a whole lot better
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Six-time losers
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Now, you must provide some answers
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Six-time users
Her window's wide open, African trees
Mama, you know, awaits the news
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I'm gonna let you pass
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
That it's you and no one else that owns
The cowboy angel rides
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
They whisper in the wings
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
As friends and other strangers
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Thinking of a series of dreams
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
I try to tell it like it is
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Don't follow leaders
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
To memorizing politics
But, though the masters make the rules
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
You should be made to wear earphones
I'd gladly confess
You know that he has no intentions
With a fantastic collection of stamps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
And so Patty calls the cops
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
On the back of the fish truck that loads
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
What good am I if I say foolish things
And your father, to your sister he explains
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
People on the platforms
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
And I try to harmonize with songs
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
We living in times when men commit crimes
Statues made of matchsticks
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Good and bad, I define these terms
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Well, the ragman draws circles
I let it slip gladly to my friends
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
People carry roses
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
The empty-handed painter from your streets
How many deaths will it take till he knows
And then complains
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Girl by the whirlpool's
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
When your mother sends back all your invitations
At times I think there are no words
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
To the cutting of fences
And, though the masters make the rules
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
To sharpen the senses
He's not selling any alibis
Glide across the lonely years
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
In the dimestores and bus-stations
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
With a big bouquet of the roses
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
True love can make a blade of grass
Romantic facts of musketeers
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You never turned around to see the frowns
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
And the princess and the prince discuss
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
You can fall down on your knees
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
And tells me of her dreams
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Wants eleven dollar bills
Seven days
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Don't wear sandals
And the poor white remains
You been hurt so many times
But still remains
Keep it in your mind and not forget
But, if the arrow is straight
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Well, early in the morning till late at night
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
He built a fire on Main Street
How many years can some people exist
It don't take too long to find out
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
In the stillness of the midnight
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
One more night I will wait for the light
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
And, since my feet are now fast
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Without any doubt
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
They tell me to be discreet
One more night the moon is shining bright
Everything is always right
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And the first one now will later be last
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
To hold each other tight
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
They tell me revenge is sweet
In the precious winds they rot
So he never thinks straight
I soon get some rest
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
You used to laugh–make fun about
I think that it's best
There's some people that
And I, in my armor, turning about
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Every new messenger bringing evil report
That might be all that you got
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Ain't it hard when you discover that
You don't forget
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
By the way, that's a cute hat
The slowest now will later be fast
I'm on the pavement
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Talking that the heat put
Well, I finally started thinking straight
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
You're gonna get hit
Johnny's in the basement
I got into the driver's seat
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Plants in the bed, but
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
We can hold up a toast if we meet
With your pockets well protected at last
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Wait for the morning light
How many years can a mountain exist
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Keep me set apart
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
But, then again, there's only one I've met
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Our Father would not like the way that you act
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Everyone still talks about
To keep it in your mind and not forget
He really wasn't where it's at
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
You used to laugh about
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
The slow one now will later be fast
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
She seems too far out
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
You are there in the flickering light
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
You're hearing my heart beat
I'll remember you
I can be just like you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
It's just crazy being here with you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
To be alone with you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To protect you and defend you
But sooner or later one of us must know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always a-go to show
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Well, I'd sure like to know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He been living there three years now
The only one I know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
It only goes to show
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
With only you in view
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
I'd sure like to know
Don't it always go to show
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Sooner or later one of us must know
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
To those condemned to act accordingly
And the ladies treat me kindly
So they took him to the infirmary
The Spanish-American War had its day
And for His love they took His life away
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
She knocked upon it anyway
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
So I run down most hurriedly
So, I'm walking down your highway
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
That I done it the way
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
No, you'll not now or no other day
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though I'd never say
But I can't deny
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
For them that think death's honesty
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
From phony jealousy
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
The same thing I would want today
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Or if you just want some company
Someone to get you flowers constantly
If I don't take the chance to try
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
For them that think death––death's honesty
I did not do it harmfully
For them that must obey authority
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
My mind weaves a symphony
But I wish there was something you would do or say
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
She smiles, walks the other way
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Is worth more than I could pay
And that which you've given me today
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Went to the doctor the very next day
And the only tune my guitar could play
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
And it's up to you to say
Maggie says that many say
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Well, I'm walking down the highway
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
I send you all my money
That I was just a puppet in a play
Well, I saw it advertised one day
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Spouted out that liberty
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
She puts it to me plain as day
A cock is crowing far away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
But you can never steal away
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
My ears hear a symphony
Don't you tell Henry
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
We banged the drum slowly
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Private reasons – great or small –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
How badly they were shocked –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Leave all the children home –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Remember me to one who lives there –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Havanagee–luh–
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Whispering your secret emotion –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Ten thousand miles or more –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
First degree and second degree –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
I got no idea what I want –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
To know where you are –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Haven't seen her since that night –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Indians camp along her border –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Havana–gee–
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Oh, my–
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
I hope that you can hear––
Hava–na–
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
I a-hope you can hear––
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
I'm sure it was not three –
Disconnect these cables––
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
You will not hear a laugh –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Hang out the whole next day –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
I long to hold you in the night –
Ha–va–
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
