I'm in love with you!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Dignity never been photographed!
Play that guitar now!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
It was the mailman!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Woo!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
You're a liar!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
She's insane!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Alright!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Yes, come out your window!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
How they ever flood my soul!
Well!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Thank you!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
Start over!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Oh, no!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
I wanna be yours!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
Yippee!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Yeah, man!
Them Reds did it!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Goodnight!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
I got the freight train blues!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Take me down to California, baby!
Pressing on - oh, yes, I am!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Woo-hoo!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Dance!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
They got away!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
Hope I don't find out too much!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Betty Ross!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Good God!
Howdy, East Orange!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
My God, they killed Him!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
He punched me out!
So long, New York!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Lordy, Lord!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
I've got the freight train blues!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Play fucking loud!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Alright, now!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
You must think I'm crazy!
I've got a million friends!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
Hootenanny television!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
They was all over!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Oh!
I ain't different than anyone!
And pretend that you never have met."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
I love far better than thee."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
You must know about my debutante."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
It's all for the love of thee."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Where you and I will unite."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
And have it on Highway 61."
And keep him good company."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I can't find my knees."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You can't blame me at all."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
I would want again tomorrow."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I'll bring back my lady."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Will mourn for your return."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
And hung on a willow tree."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Get on your horse and ride away."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
We want folksingers here."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
I'll endow them onto thee."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
"That way down Highway 61."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Would kill a little bird like me."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
That you must always first forgive them."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
We'll both go home together."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
I'll apply them all to thee."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
But we were tangled up in blue."
Have it on Highway 61."
Tangled up in blue."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Has kindly assisted me home."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
You can't blame us at all."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I'll see her soon, I know."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "Don't tell me, let me guess your name,"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget, now, you are white."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
We'll both go off together."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Come flowing down so free?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
So write to her tenderly."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
They look as dark as night."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Country'll grow."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
I didn't see you around."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
You and I'll never know."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
For that reason I will have to stay."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And punched my cigarette."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
They look as white as snow."
But I know what you want."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
I had a job in the Great North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
And it ain't me, babe,
Stand up straight and tall,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
The night passed away so quickly,
I been good while I been waiting,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Said I'm pressing on,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
And I got those worried blues,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
God knows when,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
You were striped, you were plain,
You need something to open up a new door,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Sara, Sara, wherever we travel, we're never apart,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
To shine in through,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
When there is no more,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
I'm pledging my time to you,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
In one the surface was frozen,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Using every angle under the sun,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
One more night the stars are in sight,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Circled by the circus sands,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
True love of mine,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
I just keep pressing on,
You'll change your last name, too,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Too noble to neglect,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
And every cause that ever I fought,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
Without a dream in my heart,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
The man in the trench-coat,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Ten thousand men on the move,
They lowered him down as a king,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Six months on the chain gang,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Go down to the river, babe,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
The only thing I knew how to do was keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Enter Patty Valentine from the outer hall,
And when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
I think we better talk this over,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Don't let her see,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Pick you up every time you fall,
And you know I could never be your own,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
But the bottles are done,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I shall be released,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
A million faces at my feet,
Going, going,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
I fell down to my bended knees,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
But now morning is clear,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
It was late one evening during a poker game,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Look who's back in town,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
And gathering storms may arise,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Get back, write Braille,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
He had a job in Santa Fe working in an old hotel,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Made before the foundation of the world,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
And come every time you call,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
I can't be good, baby,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Thinking about the government,
If you must cling to someone,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Human gods aim for their mark,
So many roads, so much at stake,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
It hurts me, too,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
I never can go because, you know,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Thinking it was a trusty tree,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Two by two they step in the dark,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Is looking for a new fool,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
See you fly or watch you die,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
And your streets are getting empty,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
I just say no thanks,
But you're doing it again,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
Don't wear sandals,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
It's like I ain't here,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
But he can't be blamed,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Crumble into one another,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Like as not, it's better so,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Now, love is gentle, love is kind,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
There's a ship and it sails on the sea,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
They--they show me to the door,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Never did feel this way before,
You wanna drown love,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
He had a job in the old North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
I won't have my nature way,
How he died nobody can say,
To strict party-platform ties,
I'll be on my way,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
I got the worried blues,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Well, I'm pressing on,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Read books, repeat quotations,
God sees it all unfold,
If ever I prove false to you,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
I can see the turning of the key,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
And, though the line is cut,
Most of the time it's well understood,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
I can make it through,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
They walk among the stately trees,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Watching the river flow,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
In the ruins of your balcony,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Let's hear the story of the "Hurricane",
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Grandpa died last week,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
God knows it's a struggle,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Father of air and father of trees,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Living in the land of Nod,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
They say every distance is not near,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
"Not me," said his manager,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Far past the frozen leaves,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
To your tambourine in time,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
They tell me every man must fall,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Mercury, gravity,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Don't try No Doz,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Honey, I will meet you there,
So I drifted down to New Orleans where I lucky was to be employed,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
Drifting too far from shore,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
And it's only that I'm asking,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Someone to close his hear,
Go melt back in the night,
Tears on the letter that I write,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
You married young just like your ma,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
The night blows cold and rainy,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Father of night, father of day,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
I got a wife and five little children,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
My existence led by confusion boats,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
To a solid rock,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
If your time to you is worth saving,
While paupers change possessions,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
And the whole world is on your case,
Thank You, Lord,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
I bless the day I found you,
They pass by so silently,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
You have laid down Your life for me,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Paradise, sacrifice,
To have--be on your own,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Laying low,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
I swung on to my old guitar,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Nothing was delivered,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
And it's like I ain't here,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
I leaned my back up against an oak,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
For her to arrive,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Seven days,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Never weak but always strong,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Better jump down a manhole,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
That fellow who never blushes,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
She never does me wrong,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Tell me that you love me only,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
I once held her in my arms,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
I'm gonna let you pass,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Trouble,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
When I seen him lose control,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
So I got those worries blues,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
But I'm saved,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
We live in a political world,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
To be without a home,
People talk of situations,
But, if you want me to,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Well, I'm so glad,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Out to the windy beach,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Need a woman all the time,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
And give him back the time he's done,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Stone you and say good luck,
The night blows rainy,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Pistol-shots ring out on a barroom night,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
But, if I will save you the time,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Automobile coming into style,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
All day long I hear him shouting loud,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
And the point is slick,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Had no one to go my bail,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Eh, singing just for you,
Carry the New York Times,
And pretend that we never have touched,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Like a rolling stone,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Private reasons, great or small,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
With no direction home,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
The cloak-and-dagger dangles,
Madams light the candles,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Without your sweet love,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
But it ain't me, babe,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
You and me, we had completeness,
Stripping away at it all,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And to come every time you call,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Who among them would try to impress you,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
A man with a badge skips by,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
It could even be like a myth,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
You don't want a love that's pure,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Stone you just like they said they would,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Only one thing I did wrong,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
How he died nobody could say,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I'm going down the river,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
If'n you don't know by now,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
You can raise up your right hand,
But you were gambling for support,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Just then the order came to charge,
Ye shall be changed,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
God knows it's outta sight,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
With his candle lit into the sun,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Too serious to fool,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
There's always someone who understands,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
God knows you've got to weep,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
People going down to the ground,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
You were snow, you were rain,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
You're beautiful to me,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
A true love of mine,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Alfred Bello laid this rap on the cops,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
No direction home,
Who could they get to carry you,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Look out, kid,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
I had a dream about you, baby,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
The Second World War came to an end,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Father of minutes, father of days,
She's crying like an evil stone,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Don't you tell Henry,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
And they--they look at me and frown,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
In a pine box for all eternity,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Precious father, loving mother,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
I get my sweet reward,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I went into the city, into the town,
If you can't quit your sinning,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
When all will be well,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
And I--I walk out on my own,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
So now I'm going back on again, I got to get to them somehow,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Eh, see what you can do,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Every head is so dignified,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Broken threads, broken springs,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
God knows you ain't pretty,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Going home,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Joey, Joey,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Someone to open each and every door,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I got my mind made up,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
You find God in the church of your choice,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Heart of mine, be still,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
I like the cool way you look at me,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Saved,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Well, I gave you all my money,
He been around the world and back again,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Saying over her shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Make promises by the hour,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
So he drifted down to New Orleans, lucky not to be destroyed,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
A dream about you, baby,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Poor boy never say die,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
They must bust in early May,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Go away from my window,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
My arms and legs were broken,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Thieving in the alley,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Better jump down the manhole,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
She'll be coming forth,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Speaking to some French girl,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
You have given me eyes to see,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
The joint is jumping,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
They keep it all hid,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Make promises by the hours,
They say every man must fall,
Stay away from the train line,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
God knows there's a purpose,
In the instant that I preach,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
In the little church a-this side of tow,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
And ride a horse along the trail,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Wintertime in New York town,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
So now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
People carry roses,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Courage is a thing of the past,
All you can do is do what you must,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
For the wise men and the fools,
Try hard, get barred,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Don't put yourself over the line,
The one we can see and can feel,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
People are crazy, times are strange,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Ah, get sick, get well,
That can do what's never been done,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
You even make love just like a woman,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
It's really something,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
The kingdoms of experience,
Don't steal, don't lift,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
I just don't know what to do,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
You have explained every mystery,
All them prophets good and gone,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
One by one until there were none,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
It don't matter what you did,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
Watch the plain-clothes,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
She'll surely turn to white,
I'd be sad and blue,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Over your senses you have no control,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
For the politician's gain,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Why she did go,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
I can change, I swear,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
You stole her love from me one day,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
One by one they followed the sun,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
I found my world, found my world in you,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Face full of black soot,
More people kept a-piling on,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
And when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
In his anger and his shame,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Don't know what to do without it,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
It always means so much,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Front door shut, back door too,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
I don't want to meet your kin,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
That her father was going to hang,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
You can run down to the desert,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
I had so much left to do,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Adios, mi corazon,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
When he drifted down to LA where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Oh, singing just for you,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
To gather flowers constantly,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Well, I may just swear,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
To be out on your own,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
The winter would hold no spring,
You could look at it and weep,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
God knows there's a heaven,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
You have given all there is to give,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
My love winks, she does not bother,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
He won't do nothing to you,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
How does it feel,
Of ancient history,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
The air is getting hotter,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I'm so glad,
I'd only have to stay,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
And the night blows rainy,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Then they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
I long to see you in the morning light,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
But you try with your whole soul,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
I'll go see them come down my way,
May be the head of some big TV network,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Relationships of ownership,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
I could have left this town by noon,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Broken lines, broken strings,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
So now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
There she come, now, down my way,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
I went down where the vultures feed,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
All I really wanna do,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
I try my best to be just like I am,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
To stay closer than any friend,
Simplify you, classify you,
True love, they've been without it,
We got you for that motel job. We were talking to your friend, Bello,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
The country music station plays soft,
I went back home, put on my tie,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
To be one your own,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
I've been around this whole country,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
I been riding the midnight train,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Oh, Angelina,
You made it there somehow,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
God knows that, when you see it,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Tell her not to worry,
For his age he is wise,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Made of silver or of golden,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Get born, keep warm,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
My hands didn't touch him none,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
The beat is pumping,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
That fired the gun,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
He is centuries old,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Don't let yourself stumble,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Since you've been gone,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
That the laws are with him,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
And, if anybody asks me,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Bringing me all of your charms,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
China doll, alcohol,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
And all of your children start to resent you,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
For all intended purposes,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
I don't care if you feel like me,
But, if I can save you any time,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Three angels up above the street,
They say every man needs protection,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
If you'd see me this way,
Looking 'bout the government,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Who will promise never to part,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
A hand set the spark,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
We've killed each one,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
If not for you,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
And I got the worried blues,
At the close of the day,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Can't find what I need,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
It was you who came right through,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Waiting for the trains,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
With his fist in a clinch,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
They run a brick and tile company,
And forget my pride,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Aim well, my little one,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Light yourself a candle,
May be living in another country under another name,
One by one they follow the sun,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
So, never leave me lonely,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Each time we meet, love,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Someone to close his heart,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
To keep up his hate,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
See her in that very tight skirt,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
When I was in Missouri,
I try my best to be like I am,
Give you my money, honey,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Tell me,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
You will be alright, girl,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
You have given everything to me,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Precious angel under the sun,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Hold me, baby, be near,
The sky too is folding under you,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
In the lonely night,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
She's opened up a happy home,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
So unknown,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Serve somebody,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Just to know that you are near,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Don't mind the driving rain,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Get dressed, get blessed,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Judge and jury took their stand,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I got two white horses following me,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Of this I can't say very much,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I want you so bad,
Till he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
But I know that he don't talk,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
You got something better,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
I went into the city, went into the town,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Looking for a new fool,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
We never much thought we could get very old,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
But he never did like it all that much and one day it just a-went to hell,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Heart of mine,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Just as long as you stay with me,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
That must be what it's all about,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I should have left this town this morning,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
If I didn't have to guess,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Far away in the stormy night,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Is used, it is plain,
She leave by the other and roam,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Some are mathematicians, some are truck drivers' wives,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
The midnight rain follows the train,
The angels play on their horns all day,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I wish I a-was a magician,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
My senses have been stripped,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
It's too bad he had to go,
Hmm, I can make it through,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Where the neon madmen climb,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
She said she would never forget,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
I got no place left to turn,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Equality, liberty,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Give me the wings and I could fly,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
It always has hit me from below,
God knows it's true,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
He's young and on fire,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
I know I can't win,
I just can't do what I've done before,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Sara, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Dust on my face and my cape,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Hang around the ink-well,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
That long, black train is pulling down,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I just don't see why I should even care,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Giving back all of what you owe,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
The train leaves at half past ten,
She once was a true love of mine,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
And, if I can save you any time,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Alright, I'm so glad,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Or have done something wrong,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
In the great unknown,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I'm never, never far from home,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
When you think that you've lost everything,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I thank the Lord,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Baby, please stop crying,
Memory, ecstasy,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
A foreign sound to your ear,
May you stay forever young,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
And she aches just like a woman,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Yes, I'm so glad,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Don't matter what you did,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
And think they're fooling you,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
That one doctor cannot save him,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Early one morning the sun was shining, she was lying in bed,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
She got great big hind legs,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
We'll go someplace unknown,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
It's a price I have to pay,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
You need something to open your eyes,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
"Come along and take a trip,
Honey, just for you to climb,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Rubin Carter was a-falsely tried,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Where life and death are memorized,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Where nothing comes up to the top,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
People talk over situations,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Come all without, come all within,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
The light I never knowed,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
God knows it's a crime,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Winter would have no spring,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
It's alright,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
That you'd have liked me to,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I want you,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
I want my arms around you,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Want you,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Carved next to his name,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Something about you that I can't shake,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Someone who will die for you and more,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
To hang and to lynch,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
You better chew gum,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Pressing on,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Like some mystery,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
We'll fly the night away,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
You got something I want plenty of,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
They say every man must need protection,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
But it ain't him to blame,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Staying far behind without you,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
And you take just like a woman,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
If anything is gonna sell,
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck,
Is it really any wonder,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Hmm, see what you can do,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
They say everything can be replaced,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Never needed to call you my whore,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
They don't believe in mercy,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Don't ever try to change me,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Just remember that death is not the end,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Don't let me drift too far,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
And also by his feet,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
And I'm just like that bird,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
At ships with tattooed sails,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Loyalty, unity,
In love and with kindness,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Into my own parade,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
To be--direction home,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
I love you, pretty baby,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Friends with you,
Every brain is civilized,
Without ideals or violence,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Forever young, forever young,
By users, cheaters,
No, nothing was delivered,
You don't have to feed me,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Badge out, laid off,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Dream about you, baby,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
And I'm in the shade,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
I threw it all away,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Well, get sick, get well,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Socialism, hypnotism,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
And played the fife lowly,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
And it still ain't me, babe,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Going,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Gay as a jewel when first it’s new,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
In the turning of twilight,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Don't let me change my heart,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
And he just smoked my eyelids,
She said she would always stay,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Rabbit running down across the road,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
One summer's day he came passing by,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
And when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Watch the river flow,
And, although that we're single and free,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Corrina, Corrina,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Yesterday's just a memory,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
God knows there's a river,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Gonna serve somebody,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
But the time ain't tall,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released,
Bring the wife and family,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
A man named Martin Luther King,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Went back home to the yard,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Well, I been gambling so long,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Don't tie no bows,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Far away from it all,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Keep a clean nose,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Loneliness, tenderness,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
I got a bird that whistles,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Day you quit me, baby,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
I've been saved - well, alright,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Yet every distance is not near,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
To find out if she's talked,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
In the end,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Keep me where you are,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
They say that every man must fall,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Make you spin or do you in,
We take great delight in our own company,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
And I'm so glad,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
You want watered-down love,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
And comes to a permanent stop,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
If she ain't feeling well,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
By rivers of blindness,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Well, well, well,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Till both of us fell by the way,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Vanished from my hand,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
I landed up on the downtown side,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
May be an actor in a plot,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
It still ain't me, babe,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
You to me were true,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
You came down on me like white thunder,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
And, if I see the day,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Where he got him a job on a fishing boat docked outside Delacroix,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
He's not selling any alibis,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Ye shall be a-changed,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Searching high, searching low,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
And ye shall be a-changed,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
That's the story of the "Hurricane",
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
The path you've endured has been rough,
To protect his white skin,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Got me a secret membership card,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Well, there ain't no going back,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
God don't call it wrong,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Five by five they tried to survive,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
When she lays upon the grass,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
And to come each time you call,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
He got that soft, silky skin,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
In the hills of mystery,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Look away, you rolling river,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Far away and over the wall,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Searching everywhere I know,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
A complete unknown,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
This world is ruled by violence,
Holding his club like he was a king,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
You gotta look some other place,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
And I know what you're thinking of,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
I'm going out of my mind,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
As the present now will later be past,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
To be alone with you,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Roll, Willie, roll,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Resent him to the bone,
Take the motherless children off the street,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
To be so useless and all,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Ever since I been a child,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
My limbs are shaking,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
I wish tonight were here,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
And I'm back in the rain,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
The sky too is folding over you,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Mixing up the medicine,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Just don't know what to do,
The country doctor rambles,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
God don't call it treason,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Baby, let me follow you down,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
"Not I," said the referee,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Don't let yourself fall,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
God knows there's a chance,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
You got to serve somebody,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Says he's got a bad bill,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
It's rising up above my head,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
She would have married me,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
The day would surely have to break,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
And furnish me with tape,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
We wanna put his ass in stir,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Strangers all give me the news,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Love don't have any place,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
On this new morning, new morning,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
So glad,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
My woman needs it every day,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Already the fiesta has begun,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
The wind blowing the snow around,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
But, to remain as friends,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Oh, watered-down love,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Give what I got until I got no more,
But it would not be new,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Up and down the block,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Don't let her hear,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And make promises by the hours,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
As I travel down life's pathway,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
For something that he never done,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
I love her, yeah, I love her,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Beating for the dead that rise,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Like a dog on a chain,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
In the darkness of my night,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Here come the story of the "Hurricane",
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
God knows it's terrifying,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
By losers, cheaters,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
I need a shot of love,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Silhouetted by the sea,
My dear, sweet friend,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
You say my kisses are not like his,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Or select you or dissect you,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
They say every man need protection,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
And may you stay forever young,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
I would not feel so all alone,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
If you throw it all away,
Love that's pure no accident,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Where I will always be renewed,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
You can hear them tires squeal,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Got my mind made up,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
I'd already gone the distance,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
But I'm pressing on,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
All that and more and then some,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Don't let her know,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Nothing too very scientific,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Every nerve is analyzed,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Father of day, father of night,
Well, I can't understand,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
The only son of God Almighty,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
New morning,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Each one playing a horn,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
And not going through any great extreme,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
And she makes love just like a woman,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
When the night comes falling,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
I just can't beg you anymore,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Going, going, gone,
The Communists was a-coming around,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
That two healers cannot heal him,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
This situation can only get rougher,
My love, she speaks softly,
Well, come all without, come all within,
While riding on a train going west,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
I'm leaving today,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
To know how much I really care,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
And point away from the past,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
And you make love just like a woman,
God knows it's fragile,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
I got those worried blues,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I been good,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Icicles hanging down,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Under the microscope,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
You had enough of hatred,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
By the night and been to some place new,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Couldn't even see the floor,
But evidently she don't,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
How many a year has passed and gone,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
I can't understand,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
On the stone that remains,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
A thousand miles from home,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Just like I did before,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
I went down to scrub and rub,
I rambled out of New York town,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
But something has changed,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Like a complete unknown,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Advertising signs, they con,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
I'd give you the sky high above,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Want you so bad,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Over the hills and far away,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
With what your fate is going to be,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Try to be a success,
I've been all around the world, boys,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
To be on your own,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Don't follow leaders,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
I ain't looking to block you up,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
And on the highway of regret,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And joined the John Birch Society,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Just like a rolling stone,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I have no one to meet,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Who's never weak but always strong,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Watered-down love,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
With a killer's pride, security,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
Makes no difference where she's been,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
He's the property of Jesus,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Some speak of the future,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
First degree and second degree,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
God knows everything,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
As his youth now unfolds,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
But all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
That lover, who just walked out your door,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
You've got to serve somebody,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I don't care if you analyze me,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
The night would see me wide awake,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Father of black, father of white,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
I'm going back to Colorado,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
God knows how to make it flow,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Not the end, not the end,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
In the shadows of moonlight,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Trust yourself,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I can't cross the line, you know,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Ain't no going back,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
But I've been hanging on,
All the silver, all the gold,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
For she ain't the same,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
The day you quit me, baby,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
And she'll be coming forth,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Oh, see what you can do,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
They took a clean-cut kid,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Loaded deep as deep can be,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Though they could not produce the gun,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
But, deep inside my heart,
With the juice running down my leg,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
From their fates try to resign,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Their folks, they said their lives together sure was a-gonna be rough,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
You have given me life to live,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Like you never did before,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
And here I sit so patiently,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
And there's two white horses following me,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Without a love of my own,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
It was from her ship sailing,
I ask you how things could get much worse -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
That's where you belong --
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
How badly they were shocked -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
You will not hear a laugh -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
Havana-gee-
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
As suicide remarks are torn -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
I long to hold you in the night -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
First degree and second degree -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
Private reasons - great or small -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
Disconnect these cables--
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
That can win what's a-never been won -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
Indians camp along her border -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
When it's over, I'd just as soon go on my way"--
It can't be this way everywhere -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Seven more years I longed to have her -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
Ha-va-
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
Oh, my-
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
I a-hope you can hear--
I'm sure it was not three -
With notions his canoe was laden -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
Without a reply I left by the moon -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Whispering your secret emotion -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
You do what you must do and you do it well -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
With no other choice except but for to go -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
Turn, turn, turn again -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
Remember me to one who lives there -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
Hang out the whole next day -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
Havanagee-luh-
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
I hope that you can hear--
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
Democracy don't rule the world --
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Hava-na-
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
Haven't seen her since that night -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
Ten thousand miles or more -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
Thank--
Leave all the children home -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
To know where you are -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
I got no idea what I want -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
I know they're not what they seem.
In the border-towns of despair.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
No kindred or relative nigh.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
I just go pump on it some.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
And the Santa Fe.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
Six by six...
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
So the radio didn't work so well.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Where teardrops fall.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Just you and me.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
Lost time is not found again.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
I need a shot of love.
I scarcely feel the glow.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
There were six thousand people there.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Just what he was talking about.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
I'd like to know.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
And guarded them as they fell.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
When I'm alone with you.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
That's the day you die.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Tell me that it isn't true.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
She pretends like we never have met.
Without this love that we call ours.
She once was a true love of mine.
I had so little time to fail.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Come on, baby...
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Baby, please come home.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
His voice was low with pain.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Got ice water in my veins.
Just like my own false love to me.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
I seen a man.
Hmm, tell me.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
So, darling, you better come through.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
That just struck me kinda funny.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
It's that million dollar bash.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
That big, old boat started to sink.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
By the saving grace that's over me.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
If it just don't make me hurts.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
You want a watered-down love.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
A true love of mine.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
Until my dying-day.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
For the times, they are a-changing.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
And I need you, ah.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a-a diamond as big as your shoe.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
And you must realize the danger.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Just like you've always smiled before.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The same as my father before him.
We all know for sure that it's real.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
I just can't beg you anymore.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
I would only let you down.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
When I run outta things to investigate.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
I remember her whispering yet.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Under the midnight moon.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley - that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this-this is a song-this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for the pay.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
What's real and what is not.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
I can't hear you anymore.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
You're drifting too far from shore.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
And gives it to me for a song.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Oh, her darling love she found.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Now you don't talk so loud.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Slowly into autumn.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
She saw her father's body broken.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Just to take somebody's money away.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Walking around with no one else.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did - lost a little weight.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
The sooner you can go.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Food was flying everywhere - I left without my hat.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
You're the only love I've ever known.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
And each one I've never seen again.
If you won't come out your window.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
She can't find him anywhere.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
We may not make it through the night.
She said she would always stay.
Bid farewell forever.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Of every man who put me here.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
To keep her from the howling winds.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
And you only got ten.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
I don't believe you.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Sara, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
I'm a poet, I know it.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
If you throw it all away.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
I hear them semis rolling too.
I shall be released.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Just what this song is all about.
But the mountains of the past.
He ain't-a got no name.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
I want everybody to be free.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
Come on, honey.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
The whole night through.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Standing on your window, honey - yes, I've been here before.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
Now and forever let it be me.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
She's in some foreign land.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Sara, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Got my mind made up.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the--lonely still.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
Trust yourself.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
It's just the same as talking to you.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Mary wore three links of chain.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
To kill with no pain.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
And the morning will be breaking.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
I'm falling in love with you.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
It ain't quite the end.
Got to have done some evil deed.
And they gotta cut something.
Calling out that he's been framed.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
You don't have to be afraid.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Our chances really was a million to one.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Remember me to one who lives there.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
All the faces we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
Look a-the other way.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Four by four they turn it some more.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
But I know that I can't move.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Figuring a way to get back home.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Don't remember one thing more.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
"And light on my right knee.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Things will be alright by and by.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
For your times, they are a-changing.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
It runs both cold and deep.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
But with the country to where you're going.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Or inspect you or reject you.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Need that woman straight and true.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
Where you fought for my soul and made up against the odds.
Never been so easy or so slow.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
And then unto eternity.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
It only brings me sorrow.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Ever since I seen her smile.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
He's only a pawn in their game.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
Living down Sonora way.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Yeah, here's one for ya.
Everybody's having them dreams.
He and Arthur Dexter Bradley went a-prowling around.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
We were the wrong side.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
Find out something only dead men know.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Went into a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
With all these promises you left for me.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.

And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.

Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.

Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
Finalize you or advertise you.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
Unless they're from another world.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
He could die happily ever after.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.

It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
Throw my ticket in the wind.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
If I ride back again.

That number eleven was closing.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Just like so many times before.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.

Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
So many people I never saw in my life.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.

Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Baby, two feet from the well.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.

I said that.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.

Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Epitome, rigidity.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
I's looking around just to see myself.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
But I was raised on the other.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Feel further away than ever before.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
But she had some way of finding them out.

They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Then the mailman comes in - even he's gotta take a side.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
With your golden loom.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
If not for you.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
By that soft and shining sea.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
It hurts me, too.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.

Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
I'll be your baby tonight.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Just crying out that he was framed.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Until I threw it all away.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
I'll only let you down.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
To live it you had to explode.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Well, our captain, he is dead - died for a maid.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
And neither have I wings to fly.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Most of the time.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
I got nothing to go back to now.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Someone I really could care for.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
My baby took my heart from me.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Hope you're ready.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
But I ain't neither one.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
There was nobody around.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Is gonna be against the law.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
I finally got a job in New York town.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
To which a scoundrel clings.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
His voice, it trembles as he's calling out for another plate of food.
But you're back where you belong.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
Leading me, going home.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Far down the street we stray.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
I see better days and I do better things.
That brave and devoted band.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
I stood wondering which way to go.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Nobody stops to ask why.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
I didn't realize how young you were.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
And crime don't have a face.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
At the sorority sisters' home.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
My baby stole my heart from me.
And another man named Bello, moving mysteriously.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
You got it, baby.
And I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
As the present now will later be past.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Put me outta doors.
Mama, you been on my mind.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
I'm ready when you are, Senor.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Tomorrow will be another day.
The whole world is my throne.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
And keep away from pranks.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Some place so high above the wall.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
Is tearing up your mind.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Blowing through another no-good town.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.

The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
It don't matter anyhow.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
I followed the winding stream.
To anything I might've tried.
Or define you or confine you.
Going back where we come from.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
They found him dead in the street one day.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
A foreign sound to your ear.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
The National Guard stands around his door.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
You'll do as much for me.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
I don't care what in the world you do.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Or stay all night with thee.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
To the sin of love's false security.
A man named Martin Luther King...
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
They would not let me be.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
When she's better only time'll tell.
The National Guard stands around the door.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
With the golden loom.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
I can't fight them anymore.
You don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
At not getting their money's worth.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
For as long as love will last.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Mine alone.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
When my memory is not so short.
Rain would gather too.
I once held her in my arms.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
What you'll say when you get home.
I just can't see through it anymore.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl - and me - oh, God! - I'm a one.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
See like me or be like me.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
For the saving grace that's over me.
My mind is breaking.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Ever since we've been apart.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
This kind of love, I-I'm lovesick.
Everything is gonna be alright.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
"Don't trill no news on me.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Is just equality in school.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I-I love her just the same.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
You may not see me tomorrow.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
In fond memory appear.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Duality, mortality.
Down to New Orleans.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
The night will soon be gone.
People bending broken rules.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
Carry for you deep down inside.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
She acts like we never met.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
You're too hot, darling.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
And there's no time to think.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
To know which way the wind blows.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
I hate bears.
Honey, baby.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Greenwich Village.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
I don't even know why we come.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
68, but says she's 24.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Everything inside is made of stone.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I--but I just don't know how.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
Everybody must get stoned.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
And your golden loom.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
They want me for a gambling fight.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
And discovered her invisible self.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
I think this time we should escape.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
In the night the price was paid.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
While evening slips away.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
I know the kinds of things you like.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
Have fallen from her curls.
On this new morning with you.
And every window made of glass.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
While the law looks the other way.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
I know something is changed.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
You can say I didn't give to you.
So long, honey babe.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Funny way to start a picnic.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Means another poor boy is underground.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Your loyalty is a-not to me but to the stars above.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
For an instant hand touched hand.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Just remember that death is not the end.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
And I want you to be that woman.
Hope that it don't sleet.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Billy, you been running for so long.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
That set everybody free.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
In this concrete world full of souls.
And I'll rock you too.
And tapestry of rhyme.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
And all your raging glory.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
But there's a slow - yeah, there's a slow - there's a slow train coming.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
Patriotism, materialism.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Your voice was all that I heard.
And it never seemed strange.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Sweet lady.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Never will want for money.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
You are on the bottom.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.
All because of the color of his skin.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
And get something quick to eat.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
I froze right to the bone.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
You break your promise all over the place.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
And disregards the rest.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
And I've never been too impressed.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
He's always on trial for just being born.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
I will only let you down.
I been in this thing too long.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
In the brightness of my day.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I got nothing left to burn.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Friends with you.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I couldn't find any.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
That last night I was with.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Saying wants company.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
Throw my mattress out there too.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Heart of mine.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
I'll remember you.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
Who says she knows me well.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Orders from the D.A.
You're gonna need my help someday.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Thought I was a communist.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Foundationed deep somehow.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Hoping you'll come through too.
They both rode off together.
Good as I been to you.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Humility, simplicity.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
From the little Minnesota town.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Dollar a day's worth.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
And the sails are spread.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
To see that you're madly in love.
That linger in the fireball heat.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
I didn't feel so cold then.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
It was you who understood.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
I'm sad and lonely too.
An innocent man in a living hell.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Well, I'm just thumping.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
The water is wide and I can’t cross over.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Oh, yes, they did.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
It'll never do, somehow.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
I'm gonna get my coat - I feel the breath of a storm.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Memories of what used to be.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Nobility, humility.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
When you made everybody pay.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Thank you.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
I'm not the one you need.
I have heard rumors all over town.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Watch the parking meters.
And laid his life on the line.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Come on, baby.
Turned on my record player.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
I can't see through it anymore.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
I did not do it knowingly.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
You're a big girl now.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
By the jealousy of others around her.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
To reach of your rattling drums.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Headed out for the western skies.
So quickly into autumn.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Even before you came in the door.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Everything is broken.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
I took some comfort there.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
And shot it fulla holes.
And your highway's getting filled.
Or put up against the wall.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Know not what the years may hold.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
But I would never do you wrong.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
All because his face was brown.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
And both shall row, my love and I.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Hmm.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
In my Cadillac.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
I only saw what they let me see.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
It sure is right on a night like this.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
Magic in a magical land.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
And he was a friend of mine.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Mortality, reality.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
I don't know any more than this.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
I know not if I sink or swim.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
You can make it too.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Waiting on my burying ground.
When you go your way and I go mine.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
I had something to protect.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
You're my honey.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
And left me here facing the wall.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
His enemies say he's on their land.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
The last radio is playing.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
But the fighter still remains.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
He went down to Oxford Town.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Is what this thing here is for.
Leave no stone unturned.
But these to tell what's true.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
May you stay forever young.
I want you.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Soft as music, light as spring.
Even the softest touch.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
'Cause I don't think about it.
This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
And that failure's no success at all.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
But he sure left here in style.
To see what kinda words he could say.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
And I need you, yeah.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Girls like birds fly away.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
You to me were the best.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
When my working day's through.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
For the times, they-they are a-changing.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're-what you are but what you're not.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
I can walk anytime around the block.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Crying out that he been framed.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
And come away with me.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
Went into the laundry to wash my clothes down.
And I's left alone with three children.
Go lightly on the ground.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away - we're gonna forget it.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
He gone north for a while.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Looking for the places only they would know.
He's got his mother's eyes.
Gal, you're on my mind.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
You're a big girl all the way.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
You don't want me, give my money back.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
And I'll go last.
With the glory that is to be.
In the palace of the Pope.
But, baby, please stop crying--it's tearing up my mind.
That can win what's never been won.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Havanageeluh.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
To tie up the time most forcefully.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
I always thought that he was well.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
And she had left him to die in there.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Please let me ride you home.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
Baby, baby.
Thanks.
To anything I mighta tried.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Father of love and father of rain.
High society, notoriety.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
The words that her lover had said.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
I'll hold it down for you.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Her fond face pale with woe.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
What looks like the easy way out.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
But you can't see in and I--it's hard looking out.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
But you're not even sure what it is.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
If you just let me come home with you.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
And you did it with strength that belonged to the gods.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
You can show me a new place to start.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
And fades away like some morning dew.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Going, going, gone.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
That's really and truly an American.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.

Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Come over here from over there, girl.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
I threw it all away.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
Rode slowly back again.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Don't have to look no further - you're the soul of many things.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
I don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Crying out that he was framed.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
And watch the parking meters.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
To the old folks' home and the college.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
It would go up against every rule.

But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
But simply because it's true.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.

Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Yes, tell me.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
New morning.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
He never did know what it was all about.

Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Tell me.
I'm going where I never been before.
Chain you down or bring you down.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
I used to care, but things have changed.
The light I never knowed.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
'Steada acting like we never met.

Tried to create a next world war.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.

Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.

Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Yes, and I'll go last.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Last radio is playing.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Lay dead beside him there.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Every link was Jesus's name.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Going through all these things twice.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Ever since I seen you there.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
That must be what it's all about.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
They're all gonna take on down by the bounded bank.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Wants to get it paid off.
You're my baby.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
You know the song in my heart.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Bring that bottle over here.
Honey, I want you.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
You only got ten.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
In the pale moonlight.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
Someone's watching over you.
You give something up for everything you gain.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Life don't mean a thing.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Blood on your saddle.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
"Don't point your finger at me.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Lay your hand upon my head.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
And clouds cover up the ground.
That keep us so tightly bound.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
On the caboose of the train.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
It's just the old American way.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here-it's, uh-have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd-I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
I got a bird that sings.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
You'd better get that in your head.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
And no time to think.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
I once loved a woman - a child, I am told.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
The place that I started from.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
There's no words that need to be said.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Down along my restless palms.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
68, but says he's 24.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
After losing every battle.
Like you never done before.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Behind a man's brain.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
It don't matter, anyhow.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
You're on the bottom.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
I can't use it anymore.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Sara, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Buildings going up to the sky.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
The next day could be your last.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
For that's the way I remember her best.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
They got him on conspiracy - they were never sure who with.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
To anything I might have tried.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
You don't have to worry any more.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
You sound like a hillbilly.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
That Johanna's not here.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
You won't get it for money.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
It always does when you're with me.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.
At the end of the trail.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
God knows...
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
My face you'll never see no more.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Tangled up in blue.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Honey, I never would have come.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
His mama sure was proud of him.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
In an oil refinery.
I'm younger than that now.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
See him at play makes me smile.
The sooner you can leave.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Kisses she gave him three.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
While my conscience explodes.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
Adios, mi corazon.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
When he played and we didn't dance.
You got a heart of stone.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Some place so high above this wall.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
I've made shoes for everyone - even you - while I still go barefoot.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
And you--you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Can't see over to the other side.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
They seem determined to go all the way.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Is when I'm alone with you.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Alright, thank you very much.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Must be and that is all.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
From my toes up to my ears.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.

Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
I can't fire them anymore.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
You know, I loved her just the same.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
I got trouble in my mind.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
I just can't keep from crying.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Using ideas as my maps.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
I hope I'm ready.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
My baby told me I would have to go.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Alright, thank you.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
And ye shall be changed.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Rain would gather, too.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Now they say it's the land of money.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
And relive my dreams.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
While I'm in the hall.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
And the mailbox is locked.
Evidently she won't.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.

Honey, come and see about me.
Come on, darling.
Everybody that was hanging out.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
I hope you're ready.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
To be alone with you.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
And it is time for me to slide.
And light on your right knee.
But I never yet found Fennario.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
Here's a simple love story, happened to me.
Don't say I never warned you if your train gets lost.
That I really did try to get close to you.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Thank y'all.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Trouble...
Drink up your blood like wine.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
Without a love of my own.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, mystical wife.
Than people who are most content.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
That old ship was a-going down.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
And wait for succeeding kings.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
You can't win with a losing hand.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
It was a normal day.
But not as deep as the love I’m in.
We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
If you just let me follow you down.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
She just acts like we never have met.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Oh, Angelina.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Your loyalty is not to me but to the stars above.
But my heart just won't give in.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
You'll never see me frown.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Good car to drive, after a war.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
Looking for a new friend.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Police at your back.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
I just can't do what I done before.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
That's the way I remember her best.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
I never saw the man again.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
And one day he came passing by.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Yeah, serve somebody:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Serve somebody:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Till I come into New York town:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
In Paterson, that's the way things go:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
But there's one promise, darling:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
His epitaph plain:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
So many things that we never will undo;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
All lies and jest;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Everybody that was hanging out;
I find complete love;
Had to be held down by big police;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Is it rolling, Bob?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Baby, can't you tell?
When did you leave heaven?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Just like a rolling stone?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Before he can hear people cry?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Gal, where you been so long?
Who killed Davey Moore?
And how does it feel?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
What can I give to You?
When he's standing in front of you?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Poor boy, where you been?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
By golly, what more can I say?
Don't the moon look good, honey, shining through the trees?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
For all these earthly things?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Am I ready?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
What good am I?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Too many people have died?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
The love that a stranger might receive?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Does anyone even try?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
And one deserving of affection?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's chasing after me?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Can I come home with you?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
How come you don't send me no regards?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
How does it feel?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Don't the brakeman look good, baby, flagging down the Double E?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
What can I do for You?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before they're forever banned?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Who you thought you were talking to?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Across the swamp of time?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
To love and follow His direction?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
How can I live for You?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
What?
Crime was murder one and guess who testified?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Before you call him a man?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Like a rolling stone?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Ready, George?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Can you get back in?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why would I want to take your life?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Why and what's the reason for?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
How many more can they afford?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Across the swooping plain?
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Must everybody bow?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Are you ready?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Of everything you see?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
But who did I see but the one I love?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Have they missed you?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
What's wrong with you this time?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
What else can a poor boy do?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
What would life be?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
How could they ever mistake you?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Where did you hide your halo?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
How long are we gonna be riding?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Has anybody seen my love?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Am I still dreaming yet?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How many compared to yesterday?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
How could they let you go?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Before he can see the sky?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
I seen better times, but who has not?
How much poison did they inhale?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
How many more without any reward?
Where did you lose your wings?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
That too many people have died?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How's everything in heaven?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
It was put together down in Argentina
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
Well, the dog collar's from India
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
I will not go down under the ground
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Somebody seen him hanging around
Then came the warning that was before the flood
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
So I'll make my stand
You used--be so proud
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
But now something has changed
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
We live in a political world
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
How many times can a man turn his head
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
To see him obviously framed
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Standing on the water, casting your bread
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
For what you sold that's not been received
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And your trouble is you know it too good
You used to be so amused
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
You try so hard, but you don't understand
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
By no special friend
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
She let go of my hand
Maybe someday you will understand
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
--Arthur Dexter Bradley and Bello and they both lied
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
I thought that it was well-understood
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
I'll always thank the Lord
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I run right home and I went to bed
And those whom doom and death had spared
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
There ain't nothing in this world
Just what you had in mind
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Nothing was delivered
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Many times I've often prayed
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
But something has changed
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And things would be different the next time we wed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
He was a clean-cut kid
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
As I stand upon the sand
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Roving gambler, he was very bored
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
But love grows old and waxes cold
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
And that even the nobles get properly handled
I've been walking around
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
I live in another world
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Now, a very great man once said
Everything stays down where it's wounded
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Now, whenever I get up and
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
"Equality". I spoke the word
I had to say something to strike him very weird
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now you don't act so--so proud
And into the path you are hurled
They took a clean-cut kid
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
But she ain't gonna find the road
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Now you don't seem so proud
All the sweethearts you can hold
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Things would be different the next time we wed
Its iron claws attached
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Silvio, silver and gold
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
It's something you did
While some, on principles baptized
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
And then you told me later as I apologized
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
I want you, baby, just to understand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
How was I to know you'd be the one
And suddenly there appeared before me
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
It'll be with me unto the grave
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Maybe someday you will look back and see
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
If dogs run free, then what must be
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
But I feel nothing for their game
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
So I look like a walking mountain range
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Mona tried to tell me
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
And I ain't complaining none
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Limited in sex they dare
To show you something you seen before
I'm ready for to fade
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
While them that defend what they cannot see
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Well, it's all new to me
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
From the Golden Gate Bridge
What about that millionaire
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
And I would send a message
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
You're not free to belong to me
With all memory and fate
You smiling through the fence at me
If dogs run free, why not we
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
I can survive and I can endure
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And her silver-studded phantom cause
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
He'll see by his grave
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Though its shadow's metal badge
I don't even notice she gone
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
So up she picked her babies three
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Feel to moan, but unlike before
And never sat once at the head of the table
I rode with him in a taxi once
But I can get another one
Most of the time I can't even be sure
I'm sure you're the one to blame
When the rain is blowing in your face
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Knows there's no success like failure
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
As he rises to fame
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Should I leave them by your gate
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
We see this empty cage now corrode
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
You know, it's not even safe no more
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
At dawn my lover comes to me
But it won't be over till they clear his name
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
You just pick anyone
What's probably got you baffled more
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
You said you'd never compromise
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Everybody's wearing a disguise
The man the authorities came to blame
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
A bed that is never mine
The crashing waves roll over me
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Says it's closing time
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
The cause was there before we came
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
"That I might be gone a long, old time
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Full of hope and desire
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
How many ears must one man have
When the roses fade
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
"Oh, father, you will surely die
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
So I remember every face
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Taking care of somebody nice
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
She plunged him into well water where
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
"It's only you that he does crave
I do declare
You into thinking you're the one
On the rising curve
All I feel is heat and flame
From all the plans they do pursue
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
A girl who would murder her own, true love
She knows there's no success like failure
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
But I can't say I sympathize
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Remember me to the one who lives there
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Little did I realize
Waiting to find out what price
And I'm just the same as anyone else
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Up into some paradise
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Just what you will say when you get home
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
What you're gonna say when you get home
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And the Negro's name
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Hunger pays a heavy price
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Remember me to one who lives there
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
From the start by the rule
Where I could watch her waltz for free
They say don't come back no more
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
I been wondering all about me
Lies that life is black-and-white
She been gone
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Just pick anyone
But the dark does die
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
It's all new to me
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
To give the special one you seek a chance
When Reilly's daughter got a message
I am homeless, come and take me
That she's the same one
Among the lovely people living free
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
When I'm all alone
But the first it bent and then it broke
Why wait any longer for the one you love
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Looking at hands for the lines that were
What good am I then to others and me
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Better stay away from those
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Breaking hearts up and down the line
You cut to the core
And you see why it's so unique to be
You say you're looking for someone
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
If dogs run free, why not me
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
So, I called up the operator of time
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
And plenty time for good romance
There were times when I was so lonesome
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Should I put them by your gate
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Oh, trust yourself
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Beyond here lies nothing
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Early in the morning, early in the morning
She rode by night and came by morning
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
It's not a bad way to make a living
And the cards are no good that you're holding
They're drinking up and walking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
The order is a-rapidly fading
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
But then a whistle will be blowing
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
I know that you know that I know that you show something
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
There's nothing in here moving
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Well, I set my monkey on the log
For your weary toes to be touching
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
I can hear their hearts a-beating
The battle outside raging
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
For your weary toes to be a-touching
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
'Cause the battle outside raging
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
You left me standing in the doorway crying
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Deceived me into thinking
Where the time and the tempo drag
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
The order is rapidly fading
If I was with her too long
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
You go north and you go south
Look out, the saints are coming through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Then she told us how times were tough
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
And how I know I'll make it through
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I have fallen far beneath
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Make everything from toy guns that spark
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once and talk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
The man in me will do nearly any task
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
But they caught him and they brought him back
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Well, there ain't no going back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Shoot in the back
You turn around to take a final peek
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
How does it feel
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
He's sure got a lot of gall
But among the dead that were left on the hill
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
How many seas must the white dove sail
How many seas must a white dove sail
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Yeah, but if I die on top of the hill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Well, if I die on top of the hill
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
A-how does it feel
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And if my love is real
He's taught in his school
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Ring bell, hard to tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Then why don't she tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
A girl by the whirlpool
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
To make all that should be killed to crawl
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Oh, how does it feel
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
I chased me a woman up the hill
They ask me how I feel
Ring bar, hard to tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
All and all can only fall
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And remain as I am
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Two eyes took the aim
You better not chew gum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
"For you cannot relive them
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
But I can hear another drum
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Now, they asked me to read a poem
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
So, one morning when the sun was warm
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Yes, and someone must explain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
But the post office has been stolen
How many roads must a man walk down
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
"Not me," said the gambling man
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
A-she takes just like a woman
As they rode him in custody down to the station
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
As you sit on the box you keep him in
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
How can the life of such a man
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
He got that fortress on the mountain
Suicide remarks are torn
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
You need something to make it known
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
She got such a sweet disposition
For the loser now will be later to win
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Have died in battle or in vain
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
I don't even care if I ever see her again
That long, black train is pulling on down
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
And she wakes just like a woman
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Somebody new to beat on
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Their religion of the little ten women
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
And the corner sign
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
To remember the times when I was your only man
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
Why did you trade heaven
And she aches just like a woman
And there's no exit in any direction
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
You don't need a weatherman
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
For the loser now might be later to win
Out of the shower comes a football man
She takes just like a woman
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
The foreign sun, it squints upon
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Guns and clubs followed him down
Must meet the dawn
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Advertising signs that con
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
My love, she's like some raven
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
There was little to say, there was no conversation
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Uncle Rat went running downtown
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
I figure maybe we're even
Poor boy in a red-hot town
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
But I swear I see my reflection
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
From heights that they could not gain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
But the second mom was with the seventh son
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
I'll be waiting at the station
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
And you ache a-just like a woman
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
That long, black train is pulling down
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
Well, I'm hanging on
You take just like a woman
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
But it's hard to think on
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
And all their daughters put me down
Nothing we can call our own
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Trying to get a lead on
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
To my knowledge there's just one man
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
But all their daughters put me down
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Will not be understood as they're spoken
The next morning she had awoken
Darkness at the break of noon
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
But me, I expected it to happen
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Yet I swear I see my reflection
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
In the pigpen
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
The ones that jump on the wagon
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Well, you fake just like a woman
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
She said that all the railroad men
All their daughters put me down
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Every place I wanna go
Silvio, I gotta go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
There's nothing you can say or do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
All I really wanna do
All I'd like you to do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Build me a boat that can carry two
There is a place you go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
I walked down there and ended up
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Aladdin and his lamp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
How many times must a man look up
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What good am I while you softly weep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
The man in the coon-skin cap
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
For all eternity I think I will remember
The wind howls like a hammer
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
My ship is in the harbor
The water is wide and I can’t cross over
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
When only you are near
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
In one I was running and in another
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Never no more do I wonder
The lover who has just walked out your door
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
You heard me saying a prayer for
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I close my eyes and I wonder
The face of God will appear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
I could feel a whole lot better
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
I say, "Why you say that for
Alone you stand with nobody near
So, don't fear if you hear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
When you whispered in my ear
But morning is clear
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
She took him by his long, yellow hair
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Who came here from Cuba's door
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
For I am married to a house carpenter
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And I don't even think about her
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
All you boys better run for cover
At any moment you could go under
Still I've always kind of missed her
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
I don't have to go far
Still I say her love-words over
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
He's not selling any alibis
Now, you must provide some answers
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
With a big bouquet of the roses
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
I'd gladly confess
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Six-time losers
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
I was thinking of a series of dreams
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
The cowboy angel rides
But still remains
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Don't wear sandals
To memorizing politics
Her window's wide open, African trees
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Good and bad, I define these terms
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
And then complains
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
And your father, to your sister he explains
People carry roses
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Thinking of a series of dreams
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And the princess and the prince discuss
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Glide across the lonely years
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
With a fantastic collection of stamps
I let it slip gladly to my friends
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
As friends and other strangers
To the cutting of fences
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
But, though the masters make the rules
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
To sharpen the senses
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
You can fall down on your knees
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You never turned around to see the frowns
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
I try to tell it like it is
That it's you and no one else that owns
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Girl by the whirlpool's
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And, though the masters make the rules
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And tells me of her dreams
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And the poor white remains
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And so Patty calls the cops
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
At times I think there are no words
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
You should be made to wear earphones
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Mama, you know, awaits the news
They whisper in the wings
Six-time users
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
On the back of the fish truck that loads
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
You know that he has no intentions
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Well, the ragman draws circles
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
The empty-handed painter from your streets
You been hurt so many times
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
People on the platforms
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
"Not me," said the man whose fists
And inside it with the people made of molasses
We living in times when men commit crimes
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And I try to harmonize with songs
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Wants eleven dollar bills
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I'm gonna let you pass
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Seven days
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Don't follow leaders
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
True love can make a blade of grass
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Statues made of matchsticks
What good am I if I say foolish things
Romantic facts of musketeers
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Keep me set apart
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Well, I finally started thinking straight
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Plants in the bed, but
Well, early in the morning till late at night
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I think that it's best
Johnny's in the basement
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
How many years can a mountain exist
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And the first one now will later be last
The slowest now will later be fast
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
But, if the arrow is straight
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
You don't forget
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
And I, in my armor, turning about
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
It don't take too long to find out
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
He built a fire on Main Street
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
To keep it in your mind and not forget
One more night I will wait for the light
You used to laugh about
They tell me revenge is sweet
He really wasn't where it's at
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
The slow one now will later be fast
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
How many years can some people exist
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Everyone still talks about
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
I was too young to know you were doing it right
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
I got into the driver's seat
And, since my feet are now fast
In the precious winds they rot
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
So he never thinks straight
Yet you know there is no answer fit
You are there in the flickering light
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
To hold each other tight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Without any doubt
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
We can hold up a toast if we meet
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
I'm on the pavement
They tell me to be discreet
Talking that the heat put
There's some people that
I soon get some rest
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
By the way, that's a cute hat
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Keep it in your mind and not forget
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
You used to laugh-make fun about
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
That might be all that you got
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Everything is always right
You're gonna get hit
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
She seems too far out
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
I'm moving after midnight
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
One more night the moon is shining bright
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
You're hearing my heart beat
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
With your pockets well protected at last
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
In the stillness of the midnight
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Wait for the morning light
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Like a corkscrew to my heart
It's just crazy being here with you
And I tell this truth to you
To be alone with you
I'll remember you
To protect you and defend you
I can be just like you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
I just might have to come see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Sooner or later one of us must know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Now, you're probably wondering by now
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
The only one I know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
He been living there three years now
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
But sooner or later one of us must know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
He seen a lot of women but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Down every street there's a window
Well, I'd sure like to know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
It only goes to show
With only you in view
Don't it always go to show
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Don't it always a-go to show
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
So I run down most hurriedly
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
And the ladies treat me kindly
But I can't deny
My ears hear a symphony
She knocked upon it anyway
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
And I'm leaving every day to run away
How many times must the cannon balls fly
So they took him to the infirmary
The same thing I would want today
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Or if you just want some company
That I was just a puppet in a play
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Went to the doctor the very next day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Is worth more than I could pay
And the only tune my guitar could play
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
She smiles, walks the other way
Don't you tell Henry
From phony jealousy
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Spouted out that liberty
A cock is crowing far away
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
She puts it to me plain as day
But you can never steal away
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
For them that think death's honesty
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
To those condemned to act accordingly
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
I laid on the dune and I looked at the sky
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
I send you all my money
And that which you've given me today
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
My mind weaves a symphony
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
We banged the drum slowly
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Maggie says that many say
I did not do it harmfully
So, I'm walking down your highway
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
For them that think death--death's honesty
No, you'll not now or no other day
If I don't take the chance to try
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
The Spanish-American War had its day
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
And for His love they took His life away
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
That I done it the way
Though I'd never say
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Well, I saw it advertised one day
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Someone to get you flowers constantly
For them that must obey authority
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
And it's up to you to say
