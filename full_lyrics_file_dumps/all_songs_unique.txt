Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
He went down to Oxford Town.
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Oxford Town around the bend,
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
All because of the color of his skin.
What do you think about that, my friend?
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
I don't even know why we come.
Going back where we come from.
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Somebody better investigate soon.
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Who could they get to carry you,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
How could they ever mistake you?
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
All them prophets good and gone,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Corrina, Corrina,
Gal, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina,
Gal, where you been so long?
I been worrying about you, baby.
Baby, please come home.
I got a bird that whistles,
I got a bird that sings.
I got a bird that whistles,
I got a bird that sings.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Life don't mean a thing.
Corrina, Corrina,
Gal, you're on my mind.
Corrina, Corrina,
Gal, you're on my mind.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
I just can't keep from crying.
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many.
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
You break your promise all over the place.
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Lost time is not found again.
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
I never can remember anything that you've said.
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Lost time is not found again.
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Lost time is not found again.
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand.
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Just what you will say when you get home
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks.
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks.
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels.
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice he asks you how it feels.
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Give me some milk or else go home!"
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
You should be made to wear earphones
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I once held her in my arms,
She said she would always stay,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I threw it all away,
I threw it all away.
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through every day,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
I threw it all away,
I threw it all away.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
If you throw it all away,
If you throw it all away.
Is it rolling, Bob?
To be alone with you,
Just you and me.
Now, won't you tell me true,
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through.
Everything is always right
When I'm alone with you.
To be alone with you
At the close of the day,
With only you in view
While evening slips away.
It only goes to show
That, while life's pleasures be few,
The only one I know
Is when I'm alone with you.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
I wish tonight were here,
Bringing me all of your charms,
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms.
I'll always thank the Lord
When my working day's through.
I get my sweet reward,
To be alone with you.
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The answer is blowing in the wind.
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Thank you!
Goodnight!
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
My love, she speaks like silence,
Without ideals or violence.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
People carry roses
And make promises by the hours.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Valentines can't buy her.
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
People talk of situations,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Some speak of the future.
My love, she speaks softly.
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
Madams light the candles.
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another.
My love winks, she does not bother.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
The country doctor rambles.
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
The wind howls like a hammer
And the night blows rainy.
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
I went down to scrub and rub,
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Country'll grow."
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Late one day in the middle of the week,
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
I chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
He's running for office on the ballot note.
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Out of the shower comes a football man
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
She's insane!
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Levels my head and eases my mind.
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
I see better days and I do better things.
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Temptation's page flies out the door,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
So, don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Private reasons, great or small,
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark,
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done,
That can win what's never been won.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
You lose yourself, you reappear,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
A question in your nerves is lit,
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
But, though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools,
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
While some, on principles baptized
To strict party-platform ties,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Cares not to come up any higher,
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Limited in sex they dare
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I long to see you in the morning light,
I long to hold you in the night –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing. My age, it means less.
The country I come from is called the Midwest.
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
The Spanish-American War had its day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize,
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
The reason for fighting I never did get.
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
The Second World War came to an end.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
The Germans now too have God on their side.
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life.
If another war comes, it's them we must fight.
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
But now we got weapons of chemical dust.
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must.
One push of the button, and a shot the world wide.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss.
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell.
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell.
The words fill my head and fall to the floor:
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Dance!
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
I just can't do what I done before.
I just can't beg you anymore.
I'm gonna let you pass
And I'll go last.
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
It can't be this way everywhere.
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Yes, and I'll go last.
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
You say my kisses are not like his,
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Yes, and I'll go last.
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine.
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully.
But the bottles are done,
We've killed each one,
And the table's full and overflowed,
And the corner sign
Says it's closing time
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
I did not do it knowingly.
But, to remain as friends,
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
And, since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past,
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought,
I fought it full without regret or shame.
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Must meet the dawn
And, if I see the day,
I'd only have to stay,
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
But the time ain't tall,
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
By no special friend
And, though the line is cut,
It ain't quite the end.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me.
But, if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick,
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So I'll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back:
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
She's a hypnotist collector – you are a walking antique.
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine.
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government.
The man in the trench coat,
Badge out, laid off,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Wants to get it paid off.
Look out, kid.
It's something you did
God knows when,
But you're doing it again.
You better duck down the alleyway,
Looking for a new friend.
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the pigpen
Wants eleven dollar bills.
You only got ten.
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Face full of black soot,
Talking that the heat put
Plants in the bed, but
The phone's tapped anyway.
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May –
Orders from the D.A.
Look out, kid.
Don't matter what you did.
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Don't try No Doz,
Better stay away from those
That carry 'round a fire-hose.
Keep a clean nose,
Watch the plain-clothes.
You don't need a weatherman
To know which way the wind blows.
Ah, get sick, get well,
Hang around the ink-well.
Ring bell – hard to tell
If anything is gonna sell.
Try hard, get barred,
Get back, write Braille,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Join the army if you fail.
Look out, kid,
You're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters,
Six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters.
Girl by the whirlpool's
Looking for a new fool.
Don't follow leaders,
Watch the parking meters.
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance.
Get dressed, get blessed,
Try to be a success.
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Don't steal, don't lift.
Twenty years of schooling
And they put you on the day shift.
Look out, kid.
They keep it all hid.
Better jump down a manhole,
Light yourself a candle.
Don't wear sandals
And try to avoid the scandals.
Don't wanna be a bum,
You better chew gum.
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles.
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
If'n you don't know by now.
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
It'll never do, somehow.
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
But don't think twice, it's alright.
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
The light I never knowed.
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
I'm on the dark side of the road.
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Like you never done before.
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
I can't hear you anymore.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
So long, honey babe.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
I can walk anytime around the block.
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Sweet lady.
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
After losing every battle.
I woke up on the roadside, daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Visions of your smoking tone2 shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Blood on your saddle.
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
You are on the bottom.
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Slowly into autumn.
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory.
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Take it on down to give me grow.
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.

When your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father, to your sister he explains
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Go away from my window,
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I'm not the one you need.
You say you're looking for someone
Never weak, but always strong,
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong,
Someone to open each and every door,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I'll only let you down.
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Someone to close his heart,
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
It still ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Go melt back into the night, babe –
Everything inside here is made of stone.
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
You say you're looking for someone
Pick you up every time you fall,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
And come every time you call,
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
And it still ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
The man in me will do nearly any task
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near,
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Close your eyes, close the door.
You don't have to worry any more.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
Bring that bottle over here.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Since you've been gone,
I've been walking around
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
I've been living the blues every night without you.
I don't have to go far
To know where you are –
Strangers all give me the news,
I've been living the blues every night without you.
I think that it's best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride,
But I can't deny
This feeling that I
Carry for you deep down inside.
If you'd see me this a-way,
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Oh, how could you refuse?
I've been living the blues every night without you.
I think that it's best
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride,
But I can't deny
This feeling that I
Carry for you deep down inside.
If you'd see me this way,
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Oh, how could you refuse?
I've been living the blues every night without you,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
I've been living the blues every night without you.
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Walking a road other men have gone down.
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Somewhere down the road some day,
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
You know, I loved her just the same.
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
I got a wife and five little children,
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
I got a wife and five little children,
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
I bless the day I found you,
I want my arms around you,
So I beg you: let it be me.
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
If you must cling to someone,
Now and forever let it be me.
Each time we meet, love,
I find complete love;
Without your sweet love,
What would life be?
So, never leave me lonely,
Tell me that you love me only,
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
So, never leave me lonely,
Tell me that you love me only,
And say you'll always let it be me.
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Never did feel this way before,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger.
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
To love and follow His direction?
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
You may not see me tomorrow.
Well, early in the morning till late at night
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
I'm pledging my time to you,
Hoping you'll come through too.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Hoping you'll come through too.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
I'm pledging my time to you,
Hoping you'll come through too.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
I'm pledging my time to you,
Hoping you'll come through too.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
I'm pledging my time to you,
Hoping you'll come through too.
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
A handle hid out in the dark,
A hand set the spark,
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man's brain.
But he can't be blamed,
He's only a pawn in their game.
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
And the Negro's name
Is used, it is plain,
For the politician's gain,
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train.
But it ain't him to blame,
He's only a pawn in their game.
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And the marshals and cops get the same.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
He's taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him,
To protect his white skin,
To keep up his hate,
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he's in.
But it ain't him to blame,
He's only a pawn in their game.
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch,
To hang and to lynch,
To hide 'neath a hood,
To kill with no pain.
Like a dog on a chain,
He ain't-a got no name.
But it ain't him to blame,
He's only a pawn in their game.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
They lowered him down as a king,
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun,
He'll see by his grave
On the stone that remains,
Carved next to his name,
His epitaph plain:
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders. I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend – no, I never seen him before.
Well, I saw you making love with him – you forgot to close the garage door.
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Sweet lady.
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
After losing every battle.
I woke up on the roadside, daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Blood on your saddle.
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
You're on the bottom.
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Slowly into autumn.
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory.
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
If not for you,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I'd be sad and blue,
If not for you.
If not for you,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Wait for the morning light
To shine in through,
But it would not be new,
If not for you.
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Rain would gather, too.
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Rain would gather, too.
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
If not for you,
Winter would have no spring,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
If not for you,
If not for you,
If not for you,
If not for you,
If not for you.
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
You can train on down to Williams Point,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Take me down to California, baby!
Take me down to California, baby!
Take me down to California, baby!
Take me down to California, baby!
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me.
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
I know you always say that you agree.
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony,
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back.
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees.
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
She never stumbles – she's got no place to fall.
She never stumbles – she's got no place to fall.
She's nobody's child – the law can't touch her at all.
She wears an Egyptian ring – it sparkles before she speaks.
She wears an Egyptian ring – it sparkles before she speaks.
She's a hypnotist collector. You are a walking antique.
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes.
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Wise men say only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
That fellow who never blushes,
And that is that one must always flush out his house
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
"For you cannot relive them
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
That you must always first forgive them."
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands, and pray for rain.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
The National Guard stands around his door.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Till I come into New York town:
People going down to the ground,
Buildings going up to the sky.
Wintertime in New York town,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
I froze right to the bone.
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
I didn't feel so cold then.
I swung on to my old guitar,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side,
Greenwich Village.
I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
You sound like a hillbilly.
We want folksingers here."
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
I blowed inside out and upside down,
The man there said he loved my sound,
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Dollar a day's worth.
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I finally got a job in New York town.
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
It don't take too long to find out
Just what he was talking about.
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
And they gotta cut something.
So, one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Headed out for the western skies.
So long, New York!
Howdy, East Orange!
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Adiós, mi corazón.
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Soft as music, light as spring.
It was a girl I learned it from,
Living down Sonora way.
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Still I say her love-words over
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Mi amor, mi corazón.
Haven't seen her since that night –
I can't cross the line, you know,
They want me for a gambling fight.
Like as not, it's better so,
Still I've always kind of missed her
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Adiós, mi corazón.
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Figuring a way to get back home.
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart,
Without a love of my own.
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for.
And suddenly there appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold,
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart,
Without a love of my own,
Without a love of my own.
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member, who had business back in town,
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
I just can't do what I've done before,
I just can't beg you anymore,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
When you go your way and I go mine.
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
It can't be this way everywhere –
I'm gonna let you pass,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
When you go your way and I go mine.
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
When you go your way and I go mine.
I've been around this whole country,
But I never yet found Fennario.
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf,
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And you–you took me in. You loved me then. You never wasted time.
And I–I never took much. I never asked for your crutch. Now don't ask for mine.
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
It curls and falls all down her breast.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
That's the way I remember her best.
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
To keep her from the howling winds.
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine,
A true love of mine,
True love of mine,
A true love of mine.
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes,
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
"That way down Highway 61."
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Tried to create a next world war.
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Have it on Highway 61."
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman – yes!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke.
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
While all the women came and went – barefoot servants, too.
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Why must you always try to make me over?
Take me as I am or let me go.
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Take me as I am or let me go.
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
In the image of someone you used to know,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Take me as I am or let me go.
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Take me as I am or let me go.
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Take me as I am or let me go.
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
In the image of someone you used to know,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Take me as I am or let me go.
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last.
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Look out, the saints are coming through.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
The sky, too, is folding under you.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home.
Your own empty-handed army is all going home.
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet, too, is moving under you.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Leave your stepping-stones behind – there's something that calls for you.
Forget the dead you've left – they will not follow you.
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
Nothing was delivered
And I tell this truth to you
Not out of spite, nor anger,
But simply because it's true.
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Giving back all of what you owe,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
The sooner you can go.
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Nothing was delivered,
But I can't say I sympathize
With what your fate is going to be,
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Now, you must provide some answers
For what you sold that's not been received
And the sooner you come up with them,
The sooner you can leave.
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
And it's up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made everybody pay.
No, nothing was delivered,
Yes, and someone must explain
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Don't it always a-go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Don't it always a-go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
We set out that night for the cold in the North,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find:
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price" –
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had.
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly –
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
She was there in the meadow, where the creek used to rise,
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Tangled up in blue.
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Tangled up in blue."
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight, so clear,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now –
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
I like the smile in your fingertips,
I like the way that you move your hips,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
Little red wagon, little red bike,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Life is sad, life is a bust,
All you can do is do what you must,
You do what you must do and you do it well –
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Well, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
But I know that he don't talk,
And the ladies treat me kindly
And furnish me with tape,
But, deep inside my heart,
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Speaking to some French girl,
Who says she knows me well.
And I would send a message
To find out if she's talked,
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked.
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Mona tried to tell me
Stay away from the train line,
She said that all the railroad men
Drink up your blood like wine.
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
But, then again, there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids,
And punched my cigarette."
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Grandpa died last week,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Everyone still talks about
How badly they were shocked –
But me, I expected it to happen
When I seen him lose control,
He built a fire on Main Street
And shot it fulla holes.
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Where I could watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
You must know about my debutante."
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
But I know what you want."
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Where the neon madmen climb,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
It all seemed so well-timed,
And here I sit so patiently,
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get outta
Going through all these things twice.
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Early in the morning, early in the morning
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
Early in the morning, early in the morning
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
While riding on a train going west,
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Joking and talking about the world outside.
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
We never much thought we could get very old,
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Our chances really was a million to one.
As easy it was to tell black from white,
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
How many a year has passed and gone,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
And each one I've never seen again.
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
I am homeless, come and take me
To reach of your rattling drums.
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Down along my restless palms.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
And your flashing diamond teeth.
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
If it's you my lifelines trace.
I been wondering all about me
Ever since I seen you there.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
So I can know if I'm really real?
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger.
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
To love and follow His direction?
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
You may not see me tomorrow.
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
You may not see me tomorrow.
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Rabbit running down across the road,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning,
On this new morning with you.
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Automobile coming into style,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning,
On this new morning with you.
The night passed away so quickly,
It always does when you're with me.
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Groundhog running by the country stream,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning,
On this new morning with you.
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning,
On this new morning with you.
New morning,
New morning,
New morning,
New morning,
New morning,
New morning,
New morning,
New morning.
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I've seen trouble all my days.
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Where I was born and partly raised.
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
My face you'll never see no more.
But there's one promise, darling:
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
I'm going back to Colorado,
The place that I started from.
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Honey, I never would have come.
Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
I'm sick and tired of the war,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I can't shoot them anymore,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Watch the river flow,
Watching the river flow,
Watching the river flow,
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins,
The hour that the ship comes in.
And the sea will split
And the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking.
And the tide will sound
And the waves will pound
And the morning will be breaking.
The fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand,
The hour that the ship comes in.
And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck,
The hour that the ship comes in.
And the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be touching
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real,
The hour when the ship comes in.
And they'll raise their hands,
Saying, "We'll meet all your demands."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And, like Pharaoh's tribe,
They'll be drownded in the tide
And, like Goliath, they'll be conquered.
Three angels up above the street,
Each one playing a horn,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
They've been there since Christmas morn.
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
A man with a badge skips by,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Nobody stops to ask why.
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
In this concrete world full of souls.
The angels play on their horns all day,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Does anyone even try?
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
From the place that I'll be landing?"
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean."
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Made of silver or of golden,
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
"That I might be gone a long, old time
And it's only that I'm asking,
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
It only brings me sorrow.
The same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow."
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
It was from her ship sailing,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"If you, my love, must think that way,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
But with the country to where you're going.
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Take heed of the stormy weather.
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
I went out last night to take a little round,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
I run right home and I went to bed
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
I went out last night to take a little round,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
I run right home and I went to bed
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
First degree and second degree –
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Had no one to go my bail,
Crammed me back into the county jail.
Judge and jury took their stand,
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Well, she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."4
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
As suicide remarks are torn –
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Feel to moan, but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
So, don't fear if you hear
That foreign sound in your ear,
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Private reasons – great or small –
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark,
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's a-never been done,
That can win what's a-never been won –
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
You lose yourself, you reappear,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
A question in your nerves is lit,
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
And, though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools,
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Limited in sex they dare
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
We'll fly the night away,
Hang out the whole next day –
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
We'll go someplace unknown,
Leave all the children home –
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
You try so hard, but you don't understand
What you're gonna say when you get home –
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I's looking around just to see who was born.
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I's looking around just to see myself.
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
But who did I see but the one I love?
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I's looking around just to see who was born.
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have a-fallen from her curls.
A-she takes just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
A-she takes just like a woman
And she wakes just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman,
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
You take just like a woman
And you ache a-just like a woman
And you make love just like a woman,
But you break just like a little girl.
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
You were always so close and still within reach.
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill.
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
And on Lily Pond Lane2 when the weather was warm.
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
You always responded when I needed your help,
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
I'm just average, common too.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
I ain't different than anyone!
Ain't no use to talk to me.
It's just the same as talking to you.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
I ask you how things could get much worse –
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
I want everybody to be free.
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
You must think I'm crazy!
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And ordered him to do the Dog.
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And he went and did the Cat instead.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
I got a woman, she's so mean,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Puts bubblegum in my food.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
I've got a million friends!
Now, they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sisters' home.
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Yippee!
I'm a poet, I know it.
Hope I don't blow it.
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So I look like a walking mountain range
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Carry the New York Times,
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Just what this song is all about.
What's probably got you baffled more
Is what this thing here is for.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Brighton girls are like the moon."
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Hope that it don't sleet.
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
That must be what it's all about,
That must be what it's all about.
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot".
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom".
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room.
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff.
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
You used––be so proud
About everybody that was hanging out;
Now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't act so––so proud
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
How does it feel,
How does it feel,
To be without a home,
To be––direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
How does it feel,
How does it feel,
To be without a home,
Like a complete unknown,
With no direction home,
Like a rolling stone?
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
How does it feel,
How does it feel,
To be without a home,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Just like a rolling stone,
Like a rolling stone,
Just like a rolling stone,
Like a rolling stone?
I once held her in my arms.
She said she would always stay.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
I threw it all away.
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through every day.
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
If you throw it all away.
Go away from my window.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
I'm not the one you need.
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak, but always strong,
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong,
Someone to open each and every door.
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Go lightly on the ground.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
I will only let you down.
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Someone to close his heart,
Someone who will die for you and more.
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Go melt back in the night.
Everything inside is made of stone.
There's nothing in here moving.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
To gather flowers constantly,
And to come each time you call,
A lover for your life and nothing more.
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Woo-hoo!
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
You say I let you down. You know it's not like that.
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
I know the reason that you talk behind my back –
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
You see me on the street, you always act surprised.
You say How are you?, Good luck, but you don't mean it
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed.
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace.
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes –
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
If'n you don't know by now,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
It don't matter, anyhow.
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
The light I never knowed,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Like you never did before,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
I can't hear you anymore.
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
But don't think twice, it's alright.
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I want to travel on.
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I want to travel on.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
I fell down to my bended knees,
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
I had to say something to strike him very weird
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
I've got the freight train blues!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
I got the freight train blues!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Every place I wanna go
I never can go because, you know,
I got the freight train blues!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
If dogs run free, why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme.
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
If dogs run free, then what must be
Must be and that is all.
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall,
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out;
Now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
How does it feel,
How does it feel,
To be without a home,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
How does it feel,
How does it feel,
To be without a home,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Just like a rolling stone?
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he's taken everything he could steal?
How does it feel,
How does it feel,
To be without a home,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Just like a rolling stone?
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
How does it feel,
How does it feel,
To be without a home,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Just like a rolling stone?
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
But I was raised on the other.
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother.
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
The same as my father before him.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
That number eleven was closing.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
This silence of tongues, it was building.
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
And I's left alone with three children.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Billy, and you're going all alone.
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Billy, you been running for so long.
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Billy, you're so far away from home.
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course.
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
But the town has no need to be nervous.
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
To Jezebel, the nun. She violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes.
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside.
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride.
You will not die. It's not poison!"
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes.
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky,
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes.
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps.
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes.
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill.
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
He could die happily ever after.
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes.
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
To the old folks' home and the college.
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes.
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
Baby, let me follow you down,
Baby, let me follow you down.
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.
Can I come home with you?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me come home with you.
Baby, let me follow you down,
Baby, let me follow you down.
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
How come you don't send me no regards?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
Alright!
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
Father of night, father of day,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Father of love and father of rain.
Father of day, father of night,
Father of black, father of white,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Father of air and father of trees,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
May you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And may you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
And may you stay forever young,
Forever young, forever young,
May you stay forever young.
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you know the smile on her lips,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You stole her love from me one day,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
But you can never steal away
Memories of what used to be.
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Simplify you, classify you,
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Chain you down or bring you down.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I ain't looking to block you up,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Finalize you or advertise you.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Or define you or confine you.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Make you spin or do you in,
Or select you or dissect you,
Or inspect you or reject you.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I don't wanna fake you out,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
See like me or be like me.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
I can't understand,
She let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall.
I'd sure like to know
Why she did go,
But I can't get close to her at all.
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
She said she would never forget.
But now morning is clear.
It's like I ain't here.
She acts like we never met.
It's all new to me
Like some mystery.
It could even be like a myth.
But it's hard to think on
That she's the same one
That last night I was with.
From darkness dreams are deserted.
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once and talk
'Steada acting like we never met.
If she ain't feeling well,
Then why don't she tell
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me to return to or chase.
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played.
Her mouth was watery and wet.
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same.
She just acts like we never have met.
If I didn't have to guess,
I'd gladly confess
To anything I mighta tried.
If I was with her too long
Or have done something wrong,
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
I remember her whispering yet.
But evidently she don't,
Evidently she won't.
She just acts like we never have met.
I'm leaving today,
I'll be on my way.
Of this I can't say very much.
But, if you want me to,
I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched.
And, if anybody asks me,
"Is it easy to forget?"
I'll say, "It's easily done.
You just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met."
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own,
With no direction home,
A complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
You never understood that it ain't no good,
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To have––be on your own,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
How does it feel?
Oh, how does it feel
To be on your own,
With no direction home,
Like a complete unknown,
Like a rolling stone?
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
Well, if I die on top of the hill
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
But, don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jest;
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest.
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Laying low,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Looking for the places only they would know.
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there.
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Going home,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Leading me, going home.
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame,
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
But the fighter still remains.
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Fare thee well but for a while,
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Ten thousand miles or more –
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
She'll surely turn to white,
If ever I prove false to you,
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you is worth saving,
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changing.
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin –
And there's no telling who that it's naming.
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changing.
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
The battle outside, raging,
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changing.
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changing.
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast.
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past.
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changing.
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun,
Though its glow is waxed in black –
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Though its shadow's metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
But still remains
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails,
Heading for the gates of Eden.
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
And, on their promises of paradise,
You will not hear a laugh –
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Relationships of ownership,
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings.
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
The kingdoms of experience,
In the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions,
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
And the princess and the prince discuss
What's real and what is not.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign,
Leaving men wholly, totally free
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means.
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
The country music station plays soft,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off –
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D-Train,
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
She's delicate and seems like the mirror.
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here.
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face,
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell-kiss to me.
He's sure got a lot of gall
To be so useless and all,
Muttering small talk at the wall
While I'm in the hall.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while."
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
I can't find my knees."
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him,
And Madonna, she still has not showed.
We see this empty cage now corrode,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed.
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes.
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
You could almost think that you're seeing double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece.
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
As the daylight hours do increase,
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece.
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Newspapermen eating candy,
Had to be held down by big police;
Someday, everything is gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece.
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you?
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
I long to see you in the morning light,
I long to reach for you in the night.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
I think this time we should escape.
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
But I can get another one
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone,
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church a-this side of town,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Already the fiesta has begun,
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Come sit by me, don't say a word –
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Aim well, my little one –
We may not make it through the night.
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
I want you,
I want you,
I want you so bad.
Honey, I want you.
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
I want you,
I want you,
Yes, I want you so bad.
Honey, I want you.
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down.
True love, they've been without it.
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don't think about it.
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter
I want you,
I want you,
Yes, I want you so bad.
Honey, I want you.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
And because time was on his side and because I
Want you,
I want you,
Yes, I want you so bad.
Honey, I want you.
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
(Oh, my goodness!)
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
But no charge held against him could they prove.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Never been so easy or so slow.
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
It always has hit me from below,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Staying far behind without you,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Our conversation was short and sweet,
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
And I'm back in the rain,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow,
You're a big girl now.
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
And I'm just like that bird,
Oh, singing just for you,
I hope that you can hear––
Hear me singing through these tears.
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last –
I can change, I swear,
Oh, see what you can do,
I can make it through,
You can make it, too.
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Oh, in somebody's room,
It's a price I have to pay,
You're a big girl all the way.
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart.
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief.
"There's too much confusion. I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth.
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke.
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate.
So, let us not talk falsely now – the hour is getting late."
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
While all the women came and went – barefoot servants too.
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl.
Two riders were approaching. The wind began to howl.
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
You're beautiful beyond words,
You're beautiful to me,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet of the roses
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
You'll change your last name, too,
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Using ideas as my maps.
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Lies that life is black-and-white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.
Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Too serious to fool,
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school.
"Equality". I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Too noble to neglect,
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect.
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.
One more night the stars are in sight,
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
One more night I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
One more night the moon is shining bright
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
She never does me wrong,
She puts it to me plain as day
And gives it to me for a song.
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Oh, everybody's got to eat
And I'm just the same as anyone else
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Now, whenever I get up and
Can't find what I need,
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And get something quick to eat.
It's not a bad way to make a living
And I ain't complaining none
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
And then go on home and have my fun.
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I just say no thanks,
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks.
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I just go pump on it some.
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
I should have left this town this morning,
But it was more than I could do.
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Is it really any wonder,
The love that a stranger might receive?
You cast your spell and I went under.
I find it so difficult to leave.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
I see that stationmaster too.
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Throw my ticket out the window.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right.
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61."
They say every man must need protection,
They say every man must fall,
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Calling out that he's been framed.
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you?
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
I long to see you in the morning light,
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
I thought that it was well-understood
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
But sooner or later one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Sooner or later one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
I couldn't see how you could know me,
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
I didn't realize how young you were.
But sooner or later one of us must know
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Sooner or later one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Your voice was all that I heard.
I couldn't see where we were going,
But you said you knew and I took your word.
And then you told me later as I apologized
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
But sooner or later one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Sooner or later one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you.
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
I run right home and I went to bed
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
First degree and second degree,
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
I had no one for to go my bail,
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Oh, yes, they did.
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Oh, no!
I went out last night to take a little round,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
I run right home and I went to bed,
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
You got something I want plenty of,
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
To know how much I really care,
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Hazel, you called and I came,
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
You got something I want plenty of,
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Well, well, well,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Meet me in the middle of the air.
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Well, well, well,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Well, well, well,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
If today was not a crooked highway,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
I'd lie in my bed once again.
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
And there's two white horses following me,
And there's two white horses following me,
I got two white horses following me,
Waiting on my burying ground.
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Means another poor boy is underground.
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
See that my grave is kept clean.
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Until my dying-day.
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Well, I'm walking down the highway
With my suitcase in my hand.
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
With my suitcase in my hand.
Lord, I really miss my baby!
She's in some foreign land.
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
And your streets are getting empty,
And your highway's getting filled.
Well, the way I love that woman,
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Well, I been gambling so long,
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Well, the ocean took my baby,
My baby stole my heart from me.
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
My baby took my heart from me.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
So, I'm walking down your highway
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Just as far as my eyes can see,
From the Golden Gate Bridge
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done,
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
"One of us had better call up the cops."
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Just like the time before and the time before that.
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
So they took him to the infirmary
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done,
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You'll be doing society a favor,
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Up into some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along the trail,
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
An innocent man in a living hell.
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done,
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Oh, come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Well, come all without, come all within,
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Play that guitar now!
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
It sure is right on a night like this.
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
It sure feels right on a night like this.
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
In the pale moonlight.
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Start over!
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Everything is gonna be alright.
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
You play with my world like it's your little toy.
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive.
A world war can be won you want me to believe.
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire.
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher.
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Fear to bring children into the world.
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon.
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers, too,
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
To keep her from the howling winds.
Please see if her hair hangs long,
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night,
In the brightness of my day.
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.
I have heard rumors all over town.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
All I'd like you to do
Is tell me that it isn't true.
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Tell me that it isn't true.
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
All of these awful things that I have heard,
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
So, darling, you better come through.
Tell me that it isn't true.
All of these awful things that I have heard,
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Our conversation was short and sweet,
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
And I'm back in the rain,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow,
You're a big girl now.
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
And I'm just like that bird,
Eh, singing just for you,
I a-hope you can hear––
Hear me singing through these tears.
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Eh, in somebody's room,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
You're a big girl all the way.
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last –
Well, I may just swear,
Eh, see what you can do,
I can make it through,
You can make it, too.
A change in the weather is always extreme,
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart.
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.
I want you, baby, just to understand
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
It's very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
To give the special one you seek a chance
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Whispering your secret emotion –
Magic in a magical land.
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it's so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I can't shoot them anymore,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say.
Said it was a bad dream.
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
He said, "Tell me about it."
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
It was all over by a quarter past.
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Up and down the lonesome town.
I stood wondering which way to go.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
It was a normal day.
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
I seen a man.
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Thought I was a communist.
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
You seen what happened last time they started.'
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
There was nobody around.
I got into the driver's seat
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
In my Cadillac.
Good car to drive, after a war.
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad.
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
So the radio didn't work so well.
Turned on my record player.
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
I needed somebody to talk to.
So, I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
But mine was a little different, you see.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
I didn't see you around."
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Everybody's having them dreams.
Everybody sees hisself
Walking around with no one else.
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
I said that.
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And may you stay forever young,
May you stay forever young.
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And may you stay forever young,
May you stay forever young.
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And may you stay forever young,
May you stay forever young.
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Because everybody must get stoned.
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Because everybody must get stoned.
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Because everybody must get stoned.
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Because everybody must get stoned.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Gone as the season she's taken.
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To the sin of love's false security.
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces.
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
And I, in my armor, turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
And I answer them most mysteriously,
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Well, I don't mind dying,
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Well, I don't mind dying,
But I hate to leave my children crying.
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
It's rising up above my head,
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Well, I don't mind dying,
But I hate to leave my children crying.
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
And the riot squad, they're restless. They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend. You'd better leave."
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window. For her I feel so afraid.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette.
Then, he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know!
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn.
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Right now I can't read too good. Don't send me no more letters, no!
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I have no one to meet,
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship.
My senses have been stripped,
My hands can't feel to grip,
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade.
Cast your dancing spell my way – I promise to go under it.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone,
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time,
It's just a ragged clown behind –
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands, and pray for rain,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks,
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa,
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I try my best to be like I am,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
They say, "Sing while you slave!" I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades away.
