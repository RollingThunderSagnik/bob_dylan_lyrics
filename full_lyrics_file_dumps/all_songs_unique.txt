Oh!

Looking for my lo and behold!

I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!

I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Good God!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!

Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!

This place don't make sense to me no more!
Oh, yeah!

You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Woo!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
I've got a million friends!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Start over!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Yeah, man!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!

Hootenanny television!
They got away!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!

She's insane!
Alright, now!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Woo-hoo!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Lordy, Lord!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Alright!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
You must think I'm crazy!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!

Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!

Watch out so you don't step on me!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Play that guitar now!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Goodnight!
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
And have it on Highway 61."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Have it on Highway 61."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Tangled up in blue."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Where you and I will unite."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
And keep him good company."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
Has kindly assisted me home."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Get on your horse and ride away."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And punched my cigarette."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
We'll both go home together."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
I didn't see you around."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
They look as dark as night."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"Is it easy to forget?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
I'll apply them all to thee."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
You and I'll never know."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
From across that lonesome ocean."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
I can't find my knees."
I'll see her soon, I know."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
But I know what you want."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"I've had too much of your company,"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I'll endow them onto thee."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
They look as white as snow."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
But we were tangled up in blue."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
Come flowing down so free?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
Country'll grow."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
We'll both go off together."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
God said, "On Highway 61."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
I'll bring back my lady."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
We want folksingers here."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I would want again tomorrow."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Would kill a little bird like me."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
And it's all for the love of thee."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
And pretend that you never have met."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"That way down Highway 61."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Will mourn for your return."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
And hung on a willow tree."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
You can't blame us at all."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
So write to her tenderly."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
It's all for the love of thee."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
You must know about my debutante."
That you must always first forgive them."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
You can't blame me at all."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
I love far better than thee."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
It's rising up above my head,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Who could they get to carry you,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
To have––be on your own,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I know I can't win,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
By rivers of blindness,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
And may you stay forever young,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I got two white horses following me,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Honey, just for you to climb,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Don't let her know,
I fell down to my bended knees,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
It's really something,
Just like I did before,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Don't let me change my heart,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
They say every man must need protection,
And, if I can save you any time,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
And there's two white horses following me,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
But I'm saved,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
And she'll be coming forth,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
You can raise up your right hand,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
I can finish this alone, honey,
To protect his white skin,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
They must bust in early May,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
The wind blowing the snow around,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Private reasons, great or small,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Simplify you, classify you,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
But the bottles are done,
Don't let her know that you love her,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Far away and over the wall,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
King of the streets, child of clay,
People talk over situations,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Well, I don't mind dying,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
You made it there somehow,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
May be an actor in a plot,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
But, if you want me to,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
No, nothing was delivered,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
We live in a political world,
While riding on a train going west,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
On the stone that remains,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
My love, she speaks softly,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
She got great big hind legs,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Eh, see what you can do,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
God knows it's terrifying,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Speaking to some French girl,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
As the present now will later be past,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Well, I'm so glad,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
It was from her ship sailing,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Carry the New York Times,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
To be without a home,
One summer's day he came passing by,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Just like a rolling stone,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
It's alright,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
God sees it all unfold,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
And I know what you're thinking of,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
God knows there's a river,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
I got a wife and five little children,
Loneliness, tenderness,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Just as long as you stay with me,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Who will promise never to part,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
The day you quit me, baby,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
In the hills of mystery,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Yesterday's just a memory,
And I'm in the shade,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
All them prophets good and gone,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Nothing was delivered,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Better jump down the manhole,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Get jailed, jump bail,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
A handle hid out in the dark,
More people kept a-piling on,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
I can change, I swear,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Ain't no going back,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
They say every man need protection,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
You have given all there is to give,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Like a complete unknown,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Read books and repeat quotations,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Advertising signs, they con,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Don't let me drift too far,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
In the instant that I preach,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Oh, watered-down love,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Going, going,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
When she lays upon the grass,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Yes, and I'll go last,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Without a love of my own,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
With his fist in a clinch,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Is it really any wonder,
Honey, I will meet you there,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
To be––direction home,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Like you never did before,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
In the darkness of my night,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
And I got those worried blues,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
And give him back the time he's done,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Heart of mine, go back home,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
But, if I will save you the time,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Stripping away at it all,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
And pretend that we never have touched,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Take the motherless children off the street,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
True love of mine,
I'll go see them come down my way,
The light I never knowed,
I have no one to meet,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
The night blows cold and rainy,
I've been around this whole country,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Thinking about the government,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
That you'd have liked me to,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
They run a brick and tile company,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
I'm leaving today,
The man in the trench-coat,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Without ideals or violence,
Mixing up the medicine,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
A worried man with a worried mind,
When the night comes falling,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Look who's back in town,
To keep up his hate,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
God don't call it wrong,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Who among them would try to impress you,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
And I got the worried blues,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Far away in the stormy night,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I bless the day I found you,
Hold me, baby, be near,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Don't let her see,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Look out, kid,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
You to me were true,
He been around the world and back again,
That two healers cannot heal him,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Want you,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
I got a bird that whistles,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
I went back home, put on my tie,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
You got something I want plenty of,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Don't let yourself fall,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Ooh, watered-down love,
You have given me life to live,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Don't let her see that you need her,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Up and down the block,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
We'll fly the night away,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Of this I can't say very much,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Had no one to go my bail,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
You were snow, you were rain,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Badge out, laid off,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
May be the head of some big TV network,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
And ye shall be a-changed,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Waiting for the trains,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
If your time to you is worth saving,
As human gods aim for their mark,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
So unknown,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Looking 'bout the government,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
They say every man must fall,
Never weak, but always strong,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
For his age he is wise,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
The night passed away so quickly,
All I really wanna do,
Poor boy never say die,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Socialism, hypnotism,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Hmm, see what you can do,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
When all will be well,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
They pass by so silently,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
I get my sweet reward,
Icicles hanging down,
I've been all around the world, boys,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Day you quit me, baby,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
When I was in Missouri,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Just to know that you are near,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
And I––I walk out on my own,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
The Communists was a-coming around,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
The one we can see and can feel,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
For all intended purposes,
My dear, sweet friend,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Grandpa died last week,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
He won't do nothing to you,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
And not going through any great extreme,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
This place ain't doing me any good,
I'd already gone the distance,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
God knows you've got to weep,
And I'm back in the rain,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
You don't have to feed me,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Looking for a new fool,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
I wish tonight were here,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
To be on your own,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
One by one they followed the sun,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
I threw it all away,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Pick you up every time you fall,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
He's young and on fire,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Over your senses you have no control,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
I won't have my nature way,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Watch the river flow,
I love you, pretty baby,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
God knows it's outta sight,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Well, get sick, get well,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
It could even be like a myth,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
I found my world, found my world in you,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Why she did go,
Stone you just like they said they would,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
By users, cheaters,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
But you try with your whole soul,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Well, come all without, come all within,
For the wise men and the fools,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
I like the cool way you look at me,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
They say every man needs protection,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
And you know I could never be your own,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
You wanna drown love,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Only one thing I did wrong,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
I'm gonna let you pass,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Don't know what to do without it,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
There she come, now, down my way,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
And ride a horse along the trail,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Better jump down a manhole,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
And, if I see the day,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
I don't wanna fake you out,
And you make love just like a woman,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
But ye shall be a-changed,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
And, if anybody asks me,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
If you throw it all away,
That can do what's a-never been done,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
God knows how to make it flow,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I don't care if you analyze me,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
I been good,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
And come every time you call,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Yes, I'm so glad,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
In the ruins of your balcony,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
You and me, we had completeness,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Try to be a success,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
And I'm so glad,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Spent my money on you, honey,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
And furnish me with tape,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
You have given everything to me,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
You want watered-down love,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I would not feel so all alone,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Eh, in somebody's room,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Since you've been gone,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
But you were gambling for support,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Yet every distance is not near,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
To be so useless and all,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
I want you,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Oh, singing just for you,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
It don't matter what you did,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
And your streets are getting empty,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Where I will always be renewed,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
The only son of God Almighty,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
A complete unknown,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
You married young just like your ma,
When there is no more,
How does it feel,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
This situation can only get rougher,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
You have laid down Your life for me,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
They don't believe in mercy,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Of ancient history,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Just then the order came to charge,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
God knows it's a crime,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
To find out if she's talked,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Nothing too very scientific,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Love that's pure no accident,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Seven days,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
This world is ruled by violence,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
It still ain't me, babe,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Saved,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
If anything is gonna sell,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
It's like I ain't here,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
A true love of mine,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Six months on the chain gang,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Can't find what I need,
Oh, in somebody's room,
My existence led by confusion boats,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
God knows when,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I'd be sad and blue,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Searching everywhere I know,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
All the tired horses in the sun,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Three by three they're turning the key,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
They tell me every man must fall,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
If you'd see me this way,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
People are crazy, times are strange,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
At the close of the day,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Hang around the ink-well,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
And she aches just like a woman,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
They keep it all hid,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
I shall be released,
They––they show me to the door,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Want you so bad,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
God knows you ain't pretty,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
And they––they look at me and frown,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
It always has hit me from below,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
And point away from the past,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Winter would have no spring,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Like a dog on a chain,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
But now morning is clear,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
I'm going down the river,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
He's not selling any alibis,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
The kingdoms of experience,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
One by one until there were none,
Don't matter what you did,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
If you must cling to someone,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Never did feel this way before,
And I'm just like that bird,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Something about you that I can't shake,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
But, if I can save you any time,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
But he can't be blamed,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
I ain't looking to block you up,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
They walk among the stately trees,
And to come each time you call,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Come on, come on, stick together,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
While paupers change possessions,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
If I didn't have to guess,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
He's the property of Jesus,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Trouble,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
The sky too is folding over you,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
I'm never, never far from home,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
To a solid rock,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
And on the highway of regret,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Too noble to neglect,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
And think they're fooling you,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Loyalty, unity,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I just keep pressing on,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
I've been saved – well, alright,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
In the turning of twilight,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
That must be what it's all about,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And it's only that I'm asking,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
For the politician's gain,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
And you take just like a woman,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
If you can't quit your sinning,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
God knows there's a chance,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
But, to remain as friends,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
My woman needs it every day,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
"Not me," said his manager,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
With no direction home,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Now you don't talk so loud,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
You've got to serve somebody,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Oh, Angelina,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Watching the river flow,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Give what I got until I got no more,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Well, well, well,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Keep a clean nose,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
And it's like I ain't here,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
You're beautiful beyond words,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
So I got those worries blues,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
In one the surface was frozen,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
And, though the line is cut,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
We take great delight in our own company,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
She's the worst you could ever have,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Keep me where you are,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
She once was a true love of mine,
Get dressed, get blessed,
The night would see me wide awake,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Beyond here lies nothing,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
I can make it through,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Don't wanna be a bum,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Tell her not to worry,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Don't you tell Henry,
"Come along and take a trip,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Well, I can't understand,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Searching high, searching low,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
She leave by the other and roam,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
There's always someone who understands,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
The phone's tapped anyway,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Memory, ecstasy,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Don't ever try to change me,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
You even make love just like a woman,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Beating for the dead that rise,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Father of cold and father of heat,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
That her father was going to hang,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
With his candle lit into the sun,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I don't care if you feel like me,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Gonna serve somebody,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I been good while I been waiting,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
But it would not be new,
That foreign sound in your ear,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
But I'm pressing on,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
She would have married me,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
And the point is slick,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I wish I a-was a magician,
So glad,
How he died nobody could say,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Wintertime in New York town,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Ye shall be changed,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And I don't want to drag you down,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
New morning,
As his youth now unfolds,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Over the hills and far away,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
You'll be doing society a favor,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Madams light the candles,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Not the end, not the end,
I once held her in my arms,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Stone you and say good luck,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Out to the windy beach,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Into my own parade,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Well, there ain't no going back,
The human mind can only stand so much,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
The Second World War came to an end,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I should have left this town this morning,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
For something that he never done,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
You say my kisses are not like his,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Living in the land of Nod,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
You had enough of hatred,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Look away, you rolling river,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I got the worried blues,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I just don't see why I should even care,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Tell me,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Every brain is civilized,
And played the fife lowly,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
To stay closer than any friend,
The train leaves at half past ten,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
People talk of situations,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Go down to the river, babe,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
The country doctor rambles,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Too serious to fool,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
When I seen him lose control,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
In his anger and his shame,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
God knows everything,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Automobile coming into style,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Get born, keep warm,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
I can't understand,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Every head is so dignified,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Name of Martin Luther King,
I got my mind made up,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
I don't want to meet your kin,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Father of minutes, father of days,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Someone to open each and every door,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Pressing on,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
The beat is pumping,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
God knows there's a purpose,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
From their fates try to resign,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Going, going, gone,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
It's too bad he had to go,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
To strict party-platform ties,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
If you'd see me this a-way,
And also by his feet,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Got me a secret membership card,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Made before the foundation of the world,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Don't follow leaders,
They say that every man must fall,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
A hand set the spark,
Face full of black soot,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
By losers, cheaters,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Don't try No Doz,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Oxford Town around the bend,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Makes no difference where she's been,
You got something better,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Tell me that you love me only,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
In the great unknown,
I'd give you the sky high above,
God knows there's a heaven,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Far away from it all,
Staying far behind without you,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Thank You, Lord,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
It's not aimed at anyone,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
For she ain't the same,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Is used, it is plain,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Heart of mine,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
And it still ain't me, babe,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
I'm going out of my mind,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
But you're doing it again,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Circled by the circus sands,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Hmm, I can make it through,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Where life and death are memorized,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Corrina, Corrina,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
If ever I prove false to you,
Oh, see what you can do,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
First degree and second degree,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
The wind howls like a hammer,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
You have given me eyes to see,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
How he died nobody can say,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
I just don't know what to do,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Is looking for a new fool,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Serve somebody,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
She'll surely turn to white,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Give you my money, honey,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
You need something to open your eyes,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
To your tambourine in time,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Like a rolling stone,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
You will be alright, girl,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
You got to serve somebody,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Dust on my face and my cape,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Equality, liberty,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
A thousand miles from home,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
If'n you don't know by now,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Strike another match, go start anew,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
You stole her love from me one day,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
"Not I," said the referee,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Bring the wife and family,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
God knows it's true,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
She said she would never forget,
Make you spin or do you in,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
But something has changed,
Baby, please stop crying,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
One more night the stars are in sight,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
And gathering storms may arise,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Heart of mine, be still,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Poor boy dressed in black,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
All that and more and then some,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
You can run down to the desert,
Father of black, father of white,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Dream about you, baby,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
I want you so bad,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You need something to open up a new door,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
You could look at it and weep,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Trust yourself,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
With a killer's pride, security,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Went back home to the yard,
The day would surely have to break,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Stay away from the train line,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
But I would not feel so all alone,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Love don't have any place,
A question in your nerves is lit,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Going home,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
See you fly or watch you die,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
But I've been hanging on,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Like some mystery,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
It hurts me, too,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
I want my arms around you,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Broken hands on broken plows,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Relationships of ownership,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
At ships with tattooed sails,
In the end,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Don't wear sandals,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
I got those worried blues,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Go melt back in the night,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Laying low,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
But evidently she don't,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
That the laws are with him,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
To gather flowers constantly,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
And, although that we're single and free,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
The country music station plays soft,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Like as not, it's better so,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
I went into the city, went into the town,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
My senses have been stripped,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
I'd only have to stay,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
People carry roses,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Without your sweet love,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Under the microscope,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
You better chew gum,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
You have explained every mystery,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Mercury, gravity,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Well, I may just swear,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
The sky too is folding under you,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
The man there said he loved my sound,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Every nerve is analyzed,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
And the whole world is on your case,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
As the daylight hours do increase,
That fired the gun,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Stand up straight and tall,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Father of day, father of night,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
And it ain't me, babe,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
And, on their promises of paradise,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
That can do what's never been done,
That fellow who never blushes,
God knows it's a struggle,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
The winter would hold no spring,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
They lowered him down as a king,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
I try my best to be like I am,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I got no place left to turn,
Well, I gave you all my money,
We've killed each one,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Father of air and father of trees,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Don't let her hear,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
The air is getting hotter,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Friends with you,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Newspapermen eating candy,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Don't mind the driving rain,
On this new morning, new morning,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
I can't be good, baby,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Said I'm pressing on,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Don't tie no bows,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
A million faces at my feet,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Precious father, loving mother,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
A dream about you, baby,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
And forget my pride,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Go away from my window,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Try hard, get barred,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Without a dream in my heart,
They say everything can be replaced,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
She'll be coming forth,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Front door shut, back door too,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Light yourself a candle,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
It always means so much,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
In the foggy web of destiny,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Yesterday is just a memory,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
He got that soft, silky skin,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Three angels up above the street,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
She said she would always stay,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Thieving in the alley,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
I rambled out of New York town,
To know how much I really care,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Don't steal, don't lift,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
You'll change your last name, too,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
People going down to the ground,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
He is centuries old,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
And here I sit so patiently,
My arms and legs were broken,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
I can see the turning of the key,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Everything's a-hers or his,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Carved next to his name,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Drifting too far from shore,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Analyze you, categorize you,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Each time we meet, love,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Need a woman all the time,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
I just say no thanks,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Going,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Just don't know what to do,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
For her to arrive,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Or have done something wrong,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Joey, Joey,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Wasn't making any great connection,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
To be alone with you,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Got my mind made up,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
And joined the John Birch Society,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
To hang and to lynch,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
As I travel down life's pathway,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
I been riding the midnight train,
It's a price I have to pay,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
And every cause that ever I fought,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Ever since I been a child,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Strangers all give me the news,
In love and with kindness,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
No direction home,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
China doll, alcohol,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
So, never leave me lonely,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
To shine in through,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
I went out last night to take a little round,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
But it ain't me, babe,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
I think we better talk this over,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Watered-down love,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
I never can go because, you know,
I went into the city, into the town,
Made of silver or of golden,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Resent him to the bone,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
With the juice running down my leg,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Using every angle under the sun,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
In the lonely night,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
I need a shot of love,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Someone to close his heart,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Whether you are right or wrong,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Father of night, father of day,
A man named Martin Luther King,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
But I know that he don't talk,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
If she ain't feeling well,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Says he's got a bad cough,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Get back, write Braille,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Precious angel under the sun,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Come all without, come all within,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Forever young, forever young,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
If not for you,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
They say every distance is not near,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
She's opened up a happy home,
All the silver, all the gold,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
May you stay forever young,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
But, it ain't me, babe,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
To be one your own,
Eh, singing just for you,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
But the time ain't tall,
I had so much left to do,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
My limbs are shaking,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
The joint is jumping,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
You were striped, you were plain,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Courage is a thing of the past,
And to come every time you call,
You're beautiful to me,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
To be out on your own,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
I'm so glad,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
A man with a badge skips by,
We'll go someplace unknown,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
With what your fate is going to be,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Or select you or dissect you,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Drag you down or drain you down,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
I'll be on my way,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
She never does me wrong,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Aim well, my little one,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
It was you who came right through,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
You gotta look some other place,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
God knows it's fragile,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
I run right home and I went to bed,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
All you can do is do what you must,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
God don't call it treason,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Each one playing a horn,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
But it ain't him to blame,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Five by five they tried to survive,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
God knows that, when you see it,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
I thank the Lord,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Ah, get sick, get well,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
One by one they follow the sun,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
May be living in another country under another name,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Giving back all of what you owe,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
True love, they've been without it,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
But, deep inside my heart,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
That's where you belong --
Democracy don't rule the world --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
They don't make nothing here no more.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
They want me for a gambling fight.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Chain you down or be your clown.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Sweet lady.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
To the sin of love's false security.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
To see that you're madly in love.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
You'll do as much for me.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Looking for the places only they would know.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
But the mountains of the past.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
"Don't trill no news on me.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
And wait for succeeding kings.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
To be alone with you.
I can't shoot them anymore.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
I got nothing left to burn.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
All because of the color of his skin.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
And tapestry of rhyme.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Blues wrapped around my head.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
If not for you.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Don't remember one thing more.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.

Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.

To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Just to take somebody's money away.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.

I scarcely feel the glow.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
And all I see are dark eyes.
To hold me in your arms.

It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.

Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Precious memories flood my soul.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
You always got more than enough rope.
You're the only love I've ever known.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.

And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.

'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.

He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Where I was born and partly raised.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
When I run outta things to investigate.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Baby, let me follow you down.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
What you'll say when you get home.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
I only saw what they let me see.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
See like me or be like me.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Of every man who put me here.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
"Get well, get well," said she.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
For me to return to or chase.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.

The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
At the end of the trail.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
I hate bears.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
Havanageeluh.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
Someone to open each and every door.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
She murdered mortal he.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
No kindred or relative nigh.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.

Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.

I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
I don't know.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Just like so many times before.
In the border-towns of despair.

You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
They would not let me be.
Gonna serve somebody.

If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Up and down the lonesome town.
And guarded them as they fell.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Humility, simplicity.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.

"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.

But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
I long to reach for you in the night.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Someone's watching over you.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
You're on the bottom.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
That linger in the fireball heat.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
You'd better get that in your head.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Throw my ticket out the window.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
She just acts like we never have met.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
68, but says he's 24.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.

You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
Hmm.
It don't matter anyhow.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Go lightly on the ground.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Saying wants company.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
From the little Minnesota town.
There were six thousand people there.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
I just can't see through it anymore.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
I had something to protect.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
In the dark land of the sun.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
And you only got ten.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.

I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.

For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
And that failure's no success at all.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
But I never yet found Fennario.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
Nobility, humility.
Drink up your blood like wine.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.

In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.

Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.

I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Finalize you or advertise you.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
I threw it all away.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
High society, notoriety.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
I'll hold it down for you.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Even before you came in the door.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.

There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Orders from the D.A.
Mine alone.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
With the golden loom.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
An innocent man in a living hell.
What looks like the easy way out.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
I can't fight them anymore.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
I hope you're ready.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Just crying out that he was framed.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
I'm going where I never been before.
Go find out something only dead men know.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
To know which way the wind blows.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
Walking around with no one else.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Lord, protect my child.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Oh, Angelina.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Living down Sonora way.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Than people who are most content.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
To reach of your rattling drums.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
They both rode off together.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Got my mind made up.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
I think this time we should escape.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Can't see over to the other side.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Patriotism, materialism.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
With all these promises you left for me.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
And then unto eternity.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
And you must realize the danger.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Looking for a new friend.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
At the sorority sisters' home.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Girls like birds fly away.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
My face you'll never see no more.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Even the softest touch.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
That can win what's never been won.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
In fond memory appear.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Come over here from over there, girl.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I know they're not what they seem.
You can show me a new place to start.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Most of the time.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
Someone who will die for you and more.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
I want you.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
You break your promise all over the place.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
While evening slips away.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
And ye shall be changed.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
And I was brought up by my brother.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
His enemies say he's on their land.
And discovered her invisible self.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
I hope I'm ready.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
And I need you, yeah.
I've seen trouble all my days.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
Crying out that he been framed.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
You have no idea what you do to me.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
With the glory that is to be.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
You can make it too.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
The country doctor rambles.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Oh, convey herself away.
My mind is breaking.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Blowing through another no-good town.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
In my Cadillac.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Wasn't any difference to me.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
If you won't come out your window.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
Turned on my record player.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
And I've never been too impressed.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
You got a heart of stone.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
For the times, they are a-changing.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
I got a bird that sings.
That old ship was a-going down.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
When I'm alone with you.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And get something quick to eat.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Suffering like a fool.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Drifting too far from shore.
Soft as music, light as spring.
Under the midnight moon.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
I just can't beg you anymore.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Come on, darling.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Good as I been to you.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Oh, her darling love she found.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
I used to care, but things have changed.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
People sleeping in broken beds.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
Just you and me.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
He ain't-a got no name.
Duality, mortality.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Madams light the candles.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
She once was a true love of mine.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Lost time is not found again.
He could die happily ever after.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
She's in some foreign land.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
On the caboose of the train.
Tried to create a next world war.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Baby, please come home.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
That's the way I remember her best.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Or put up against the wall.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Lay your hand upon my head.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Rain would gather, too.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
As if a wedding vow.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
At not getting their money's worth.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
A man named Martin Luther King...
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Down to New Orleans.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Trying to create a next world war.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
We may not make it through the night.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Father of love and father of rain.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
In an oil refinery.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Baby, baby...
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
He's got his mother's eyes.
That must be what it's all about.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Your son is coming back from the war.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
The sooner you can leave.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
I's looking around just to see myself.
I did not do it knowingly.
You are on the bottom.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
To kill with no pain.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
That number eleven was closing.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
In the pale moonlight.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
And they gotta cut something.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
To which a scoundrel clings.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
She saw her father's body broken.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Is just equality in school.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
And laid his life on the line.
Now they say it's the land of money.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Got to have done some evil deed.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
If'n you don't know by now.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
And rivers that ran through every day.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
I froze right to the bone.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
When my working day's through.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
The National Guard stands around his door.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
And your golden loom.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
So many people I never saw in my life.

They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Thought I was a communist.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
I just go pump on it some.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
I can't use it anymore.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
I once held her in my arms.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
But he sure left here in style.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
About an old man that never done wrong.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
You may not see me tomorrow.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Yes, and I'll go last.
You'll never see me frown.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Police at your back.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.

After losing every battle.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.

I stood wondering which way to go.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
To anything I might have tried.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Friends with you.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
May you stay forever young.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
From my toes up to my ears.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
A-lord, protect my child.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
And each one I've never seen again.
And the sails are spread.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
It's that million dollar bash.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Please quit your low-down ways.
The words that her lover had said.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Epitome, rigidity.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
I just can't keep from crying.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Under the hedges.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Tangled up in blue.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
"And light on my right knee.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
You give something up for everything you gain.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
I'm younger than that now.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
You don't have to be afraid.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Hoping you'll come through too.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
I can't hear you anymore.
But she had some way of finding them out.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
I shall be released.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Using ideas as my maps.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
The time and the place that we'd part.
At my window with a broken wing.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
In the brightness of my day.
All because his face was brown.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Close your eyes, close the door.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Neighborhood bully.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
To anything I might've tried.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
He never did know what it was all about.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Waiting on my burying ground.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Bring that bottle over here.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
That I left in the French Quarter.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
But I would never do you wrong.
My baby took my heart from me.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Got ice water in my veins.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
Till your error you clearly learn.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
If you just let me come home with you.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Without ideals or violence.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
But simply because it's true.
Come on, baby.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
But I ain't neither one.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
What's real and what is not.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Hope you're ready.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
I see that stationmaster too.
I'm falling in love with you.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
We were the wrong side.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
But you're never sure why you're here.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
That set everybody free.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Memories of what used to be.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
I said that.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
It always does when you're with me.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
I just can't do what I done before.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
Someone I really could care for.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
I'd give anything to be with you.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
And crime don't have a face.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Going through all these things twice.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
But you're back where you belong.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
New morning.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
She pretends like we never have met.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
I can walk anytime around the block.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
When she's better only time'll tell.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Wants to get it paid off.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Bid farewell forever.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
While I'm in the hall.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
What some people are gonna do for money.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Or define you or confine you.
Ever since we've been apart.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
68, but says she's 24.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Nothing done and nothing said.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
So quickly into autumn.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Blood on your saddle.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Last radio is playing.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Four by four they turn it some more.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
But you break just like a little girl.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
She can't find him anywhere.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.

Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.

'Cause I don't think about it.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.

Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.

We'll bring you up there on a ship.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.

And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.

Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
You're gonna need my help someday.

Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.

It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
You're my baby.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
Please let me ride you home.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Like you never done before.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
It runs both cold and deep.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
The whole world is my throne.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
But you were tangled up in blue.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
I know something is changed.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
For that's the way I remember her best.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Man is opposed to fair play:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
His epitaph plain:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
But there's one promise, darling:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Till I come into New York town:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
So many things that we never will undo;
All lies and jest;
Make promises by the hour;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Everybody that was hanging out;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Crumble into one another;
Had to be held down by big police;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Some speak of the future;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
I find complete love;
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>

<i>What?</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>

<p>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Just like a rolling stone?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Must everybody bow?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Has anybody seen my love?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
How many more without any reward?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Too many people have died?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Gal, where you been so long?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Oh, how could you refuse?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
And one deserving of affection?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Am I ready?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's gonna let it roll?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Why must you always try to make me over?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Baby, can't you tell?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before he can hear people cry?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
By golly, what more can I say?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
What would life be?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Have they missed you?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Does he change the course of rivers?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
To love and follow His direction?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
How much poison did they inhale?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
That too many people have died?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
What else can a poor boy do?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Across the swamp of time?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Where did you hide your halo?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
How many more can they afford?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Before you call him a man?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
How could they ever mistake you?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When did you leave heaven?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Why would I want to take your life?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
When he's standing in front of you?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
What's wrong with you this time?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
How does it feel?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
And how does it feel?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Are you ready?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
How many paths did they try and fail?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Don't you remember making baby love?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
How could they let you go?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Is it rolling, Bob?
How's everything in heaven?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Am I still dreaming yet?
What can I give to You?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
But am I still dreaming yet?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Like a rolling stone?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
How many compared to yesterday?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
For all these earthly things?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
What can I do for You?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Across the swooping plain?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Before they're allowed to be free?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Before they're forever banned?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Of everything you see?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Before he can see the sky?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Oh, so why not you and me?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
What good am I?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Where did you lose your wings?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Can I come home with you?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Poor boy, where you been?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Oh, where are you tonight?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why and what's the reason for?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Does anyone even try?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Did you respect me for what I did?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Can you get back in?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
How can I live for You?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Baby, can I come home with you?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
So I can know if I'm really real?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
I will not go down under the ground
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
So I'll make my stand
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
But all that suffering was not to be compared
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Many times I've often prayed
You used––be so proud
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
All the sweethearts you can hold
Its iron claws attached
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, a very great man once said
You used to be so amused
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
But now something has changed
I want you, baby, just to understand
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
We live in a political world
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Silvio, silver and gold
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
I had to say something to strike him very weird
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
But something has changed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
How many times can a man turn his head
I run right home and I went to bed
While some, on principles baptized
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Standing on the water, casting your bread
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
And your trouble is you know it too good
She let go of my hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
And then you told me later as I apologized
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Everything stays down where it's wounded
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
He was a clean-cut kid
Maybe someday you will understand
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
It's something you did
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Now you don't act so––so proud
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
"Equality". I spoke the word
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And those whom doom and death had spared
Somebody seen him hanging around
There ain't nothing in this world
And things would be different the next time we wed
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Nothing was delivered
To see him obviously framed
They took a clean-cut kid
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
But she ain't gonna find the road
Now, whenever I get up and
Things would be different the next time we wed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
As I stand upon the sand
Just what you had in mind
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And into the path you are hurled
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
I'll always thank the Lord
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
He wagged his tail and shook his head
I've been walking around
Now you don't seem so proud
For what you sold that's not been received
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
And that even the nobles get properly handled
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Either from the mountains of Madrid
By no special friend
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Roving gambler, he was very bored
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
I live in another world
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
I thought that it was well-understood
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
See the primitive wallflower freeze
With all memory and fate
Better stay away from those
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Mona tried to tell me
Knows there's no success like failure
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
I am homeless, come and take me
You said you'd never compromise
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
I'm sure you're the one to blame
She knows there's no success like failure
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
A bed that is never mine
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
So, I called up the operator of time
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Maybe someday you will look back and see
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
On the rising curve
If dogs run free, why not we
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Everybody's wearing a disguise
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
I don't even notice she gone
The crashing waves roll over me
"That I might be gone a long, old time
You're not free to belong to me
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Lies that life is black-and-white
I been wondering all about me
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Why wait any longer for the one you love
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
But it won't be over till they clear his name
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
To show you something you seen before
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
When the roses fade
And never sat once at the head of the table
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
But I can get another one
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
You cut to the core
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
You just pick anyone
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
What good am I then to others and me
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
So I look like a walking mountain range
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Just what you will say when you get home
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Limited in sex they dare
The cause was there before we came
I'm ready for to fade
What about that millionaire
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
She plunged him into well water where
A girl who would murder her own, true love
You into thinking you're the one
Full of hope and desire
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Well, it's all new to me
You smiling through the fence at me
Little did I realize
And suddenly there appeared before me
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Remember me to the one who lives there
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
We see this empty cage now corrode
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
How many ears must one man have
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
If dogs run free, why not me
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
It's all new to me
And you see why it's so unique to be
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Well, six white horses that you did promise
She been gone
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Should I put them by your gate
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
So up she picked her babies three
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
I rode with him in a taxi once
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
When the rain is blowing in your face
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
From the start by the rule
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Waiting to find out what price
You say you're looking for someone
What you're gonna say when you get home
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Just pick anyone
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
But I feel nothing for their game
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
It's getting dark, too dark to see
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
So I remember every face
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
But I can't say I sympathize
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Though its shadow's metal badge
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Among the lovely people living free
Should I leave them by your gate
And the Negro's name
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
"It's only you that he does crave
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
And I ain't complaining none
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
The man the authorities came to blame
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Up into some paradise
It'll be with me unto the grave
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Says it's closing time
And I would send a message
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
I do declare
Breaking hearts up and down the line
All I feel is heat and flame
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
While them that defend what they cannot see
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
If dogs run free, then what must be
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
You know, it's not even safe no more
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Feel to moan, but unlike before
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
What's probably got you baffled more
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
From all the plans they do pursue
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And plenty time for good romance
He'll see by his grave
And I'm just the same as anyone else
As he rises to fame
I can survive and I can endure
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Looking at hands for the lines that were
There were times when I was so lonesome
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
That she's the same one
Hunger pays a heavy price
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
But the dark does die
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Most of the time I can't even be sure
To give the special one you seek a chance
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
They say don't come back no more
Remember me to one who lives there
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
When I'm all alone
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Taking care of somebody nice
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
How was I to know you'd be the one
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
At dawn my lover comes to me
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
Trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
The battle outside raging
And the cards are no good that you're holding
What am I saying? What am I knowing
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Deceived me into thinking
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
For your weary toes to be touching
You left me standing in the doorway crying
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
If I was with her too long
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
She rode by night and came by morning
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
'Cause the battle outside raging
The order is rapidly fading
It's not a bad way to make a living
But then a whistle will be blowing
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Where the time and the tempo drag
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Beyond here lies nothing
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
The order is a-rapidly fading
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
There's nothing in here moving
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
They're drinking up and walking
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
And there's no telling who that it's naming
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Well, I set my monkey on the log
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Then she told us how times were tough
And how I know I'll make it through
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Look out, the saints are coming through
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
You go north and you go south
I have fallen far beneath
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Shoot in the back
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
The man in me will do nearly any task
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Well, there ain't no going back
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
You turn around to take a final peek
But they caught him and they brought him back
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Her voice once and talk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
I wish she'd unlock
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Ring bell, hard to tell
A-how does it feel
How does it feel
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Then why don't she tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
He's sure got a lot of gall
Ring bar, hard to tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
But among the dead that were left on the hill
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
They ask me how I feel
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Oh, how does it feel
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
As the last fire-truck from hell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
How many seas must a white dove sail
He's taught in his school
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
All and all can only fall
And if my love is real
How many seas must the white dove sail
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
A girl by the whirlpool
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Muttering small talk at the wall
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
You better not chew gum
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But I can hear another drum
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
And remain as I am
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
"For you cannot relive them
Two eyes took the aim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Now, they asked me to read a poem
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
And there's no exit in any direction
Darkness at the break of noon
But me, I expected it to happen
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
All their daughters put me down
Have died in battle or in vain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
In the pigpen
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
The ones that jump on the wagon
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Nothing we can call our own
You don't need a weatherman
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And the corner sign
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
How can the life of such a man
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
For the loser now might be later to win
I figure maybe we're even
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
And she aches just like a woman
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Well, I'm hanging on
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Will not be understood as they're spoken
He got that fortress on the mountain
Advertising signs that con
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
My love, she's like some raven
That long, black train is pulling down
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Why did you trade heaven
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Out of the shower comes a football man
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Somebody new to beat on
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
But I swear I see my reflection
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
To remember the times when I was your only man
Suicide remarks are torn
Yes, and someone must explain
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And she wakes just like a woman
"Not me," said the gambling man
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
I don't even care if I ever see her again
But the post office has been stolen
Guns and clubs followed him down
I'll be waiting at the station
And all their daughters put me down
Well, you fake just like a woman
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
That long, black train is pulling on down
From heights that they could not gain
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Uncle Rat went running downtown
For the loser now will be later to win
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Poor boy in a red-hot town
In ceremonies of the horsemen
As you sit on the box you keep him in
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
How many roads must a man walk down
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
And you ache a-just like a woman
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
She takes just like a woman
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
The foreign sun, it squints upon
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Trying to get a lead on
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
She got such a sweet disposition
Their religion of the little ten women
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
To my knowledge there's just one man
You need something to make it known
Must meet the dawn
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
There was little to say, there was no conversation
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
You take just like a woman
A-she takes just like a woman
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
But all their daughters put me down
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
But it's hard to think on
But the second mom was with the seventh son
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Yet I swear I see my reflection
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
The next morning she had awoken
She said that all the railroad men
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
All I'd like you to do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
There's nothing you can say or do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
All I really wanna do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Every place I wanna go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
There is a place you go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Silvio, I gotta go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Man in the coon-skin cap
Aladdin and his lamp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The man in the coon-skin cap
I walked down there and ended up
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
How many times must a man look up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What good am I while you softly weep
The wind howls like a hammer
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I close my eyes and I wonder
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Who came here from Cuba's door
Alone you stand with nobody near
All you boys better run for cover
I don't have to go far
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
In one I was running and in another
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
You heard me saying a prayer for
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I could feel a whole lot better
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
She took him by his long, yellow hair
The lover who has just walked out your door
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
For I am married to a house carpenter
But morning is clear
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
So, don't fear if you hear
When you whispered in my ear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Never no more do I wonder
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
The face of God will appear
Still I say her love-words over
I say, "Why you say that for
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
My ship is in the harbor
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
At any moment you could go under
And I don't even think about her
When only you are near
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
For all eternity I think I will remember
Still I've always kind of missed her
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Romantic facts of musketeers
I try to tell it like it is
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Seven days
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Good and bad, I define these terms
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
They whisper in the wings
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
To sharpen the senses
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
And then complains
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
In the dimestores and bus-stations
To the cutting of fences
Don't follow leaders
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
We living in times when men commit crimes
People on the platforms
And your father, to your sister he explains
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Mama, you know, awaits the news
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
You never turned around to see the frowns
Six-time losers
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
You been hurt so many times
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Girl by the whirlpool's
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You can fall down on your knees
You know that he has no intentions
As friends and other strangers
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
With a fantastic collection of stamps
The empty-handed painter from your streets
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
What good am I if I say foolish things
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
With a big bouquet of the roses
And the princess and the prince discuss
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Don't wear sandals
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Six-time users
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
He's not selling any alibis
The cowboy angel rides
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
And the poor white remains
True love can make a blade of grass
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I'd gladly confess
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Glide across the lonely years
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
That it's you and no one else that owns
And inside it with the people made of molasses
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And tells me of her dreams
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
On the back of the fish truck that loads
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Statues made of matchsticks
Now, you must provide some answers
Her window's wide open, African trees
Thinking of a series of dreams
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
You should be made to wear earphones
And, though the masters make the rules
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And I try to harmonize with songs
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
People carry roses
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Wants eleven dollar bills
At times I think there are no words
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
To memorizing politics
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
But still remains
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
I'm gonna let you pass
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
But, though the masters make the rules
Well, the ragman draws circles
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And so Patty calls the cops
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
They tell me revenge is sweet
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
In the stillness of the midnight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Ain't it hard when you discover that
With your pockets well protected at last
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
And, since my feet are now fast
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
I'm moving after midnight
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
To hold each other tight
He really wasn't where it's at
You used to laugh about
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
How many years can some people exist
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
How many years can a mountain exist
Without any doubt
Oh, everybody's got to eat
One more night I will wait for the light
I'm on the pavement
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Everything is always right
To keep it in your mind and not forget
They tell me to be discreet
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Plants in the bed, but
I soon get some rest
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
You used to laugh–make fun about
You are there in the flickering light
Someday, everything is gonna be different
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
And the first one now will later be last
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
So he never thinks straight
It don't take too long to find out
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
But, if the arrow is straight
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Wait for the morning light
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
The slow one now will later be fast
She seems too far out
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
I got into the driver's seat
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Everyone still talks about
Johnny's in the basement
You don't forget
The slowest now will later be fast
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Keep it in your mind and not forget
And I, in my armor, turning about
You're gonna get hit
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
One more night the moon is shining bright
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
But, then again, there's only one I've met
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
I think that it's best
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Talking that the heat put
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
We can hold up a toast if we meet
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
He built a fire on Main Street
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
There's some people that
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Yet you know there is no answer fit
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
In the precious winds they rot
That might be all that you got
Keep me set apart
Every new messenger bringing evil report
By the way, that's a cute hat
You're hearing my heart beat
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I just might have to come see you
It's just crazy being here with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I'll remember you
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To be alone with you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
And I tell this truth to you
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
I'd sure like to know
It only goes to show
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Well, I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
He been living there three years now
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Down every street there's a window
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Sooner or later one of us must know
But sooner or later one of us must know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
The only one I know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
Don't it always a-go to show
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Don't it always go to show
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And that which you've given me today
For them that think death's honesty
And it's up to you to say
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
She puts it to me plain as day
I did not do it harmfully
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
And the ladies treat me kindly
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Well, I'm walking down the highway
To those condemned to act accordingly
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Well, I saw it advertised one day
And for His love they took His life away
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Though I'd never say
My ears hear a symphony
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
But I can't deny
How many times must the cannon balls fly
And the only tune my guitar could play
My mind weaves a symphony
So, I'm walking down your highway
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
We banged the drum slowly
Is worth more than I could pay
That I was just a puppet in a play
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Spouted out that liberty
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
She smiles, walks the other way
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
If I don't take the chance to try
And I'm leaving every day to run away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
So they took him to the infirmary
But I wish there was something you would do or say
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
For them that must obey authority
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
But you can never steal away
Maggie says that many say
I send you all my money
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
The same thing I would want today
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
From phony jealousy
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
A cock is crowing far away
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
No, you'll not now or no other day
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
For them that think death––death's honesty
She starts to speak, but he walks away
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
She knocked upon it anyway
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Don't you tell Henry
The Spanish-American War had its day
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
That I done it the way
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Or if you just want some company
So I run down most hurriedly
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Went to the doctor the very next day
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Seven more years I longed to have her –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Disconnect these cables––
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Whispering your secret emotion –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
It can't be this way everywhere –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
I'm sure it was not three –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Haven't seen her since that night –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
As suicide remarks are torn –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
I long to hold you in the night –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Oh, my–
You will not hear a laugh –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
I hope that you can hear––
Though its glow is waxed in black –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
For seven long years I courted Sally –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Hava–na–
I got no idea what I want –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Indians camp along her border –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
First degree and second degree –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Remember me to one who lives there –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Hang out the whole next day –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
I a-hope you can hear––
You do what you must do and you do it well –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Havana–gee–
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Havanagee–luh–
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Private reasons – great or small –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Leave all the children home –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Ten thousand miles or more –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
How badly they were shocked –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
To know where you are –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Ha–va–
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
That can win what's a-never been won –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
