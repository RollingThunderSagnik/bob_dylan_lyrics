Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Woo-hoo!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Dance!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Woo!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
I've got a million friends!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
I've got the freight train blues!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
He punched me out!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Thank you!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie - ain't running any race!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
I figured they was in my TV set!
I got the freight train blues!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
You must think I'm crazy!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Well!
Dignity never been photographed!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Oh, no!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
My God, they killed Him!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Pressing on - oh, yes, I am!
[incoherent] on the avenue, oh, yeah!
It was the mailman!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
I wanna be yours!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Play fucking loud!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
They got away!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Them Reds did it!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Alright, now!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Take me down to California, baby!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Start over!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
Oh, yeah!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Betty Ross!
I ain't different than anyone!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
You're a liar!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
So long, New York!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Yes, come out your window!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
I'm in love with you!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Alright!
Good God!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
They was all over!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Howdy, East Orange!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Lordy, Lord!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Oh!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, yeah!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
She's insane!
How they ever flood my soul!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Yeah, man!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
She makes love like a woman - yes, she does!
Play that guitar now!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, ah! Yeah!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Looking for my lo and behold!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Hootenanny television!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Yippee!
You make love like a woman - yes, you do!
Goodnight!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
God said, "On Highway 61."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
They look as white as snow."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
We'll both go home together."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
And have it on Highway 61."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Where you and I will unite."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
"Is it easy to forget?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
We want folksingers here."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
I'll bring back my lady."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
That you must always first forgive them."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
And punched my cigarette."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
You and I'll never know."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
I'll endow them onto thee."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
And keep him good company."
And pretend that you never have met."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Tangled up in blue."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
I'll see her soon, I know."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Will mourn for your return."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
It's all for the love of thee."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
I would want again tomorrow."
I love far better than thee."
But we were tangled up in blue."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
You must know about my debutante."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
And hung on a willow tree."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "Don't tell me, let me guess your name,"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"That way down Highway 61."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Come flowing down so free?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Get on your horse and ride away."
And it's all for the love of thee."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
We'll both go off together."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
"Have you seen dignity?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
You can't blame me at all."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
I can't find my knees."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
From across that lonesome ocean."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
For that reason I will have to stay."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
So write to her tenderly."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"I've had too much of your company,"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
They look as dark as night."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
I didn't see you around."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Would kill a little bird like me."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Have it on Highway 61."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
You can't blame us at all."
Country'll grow."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
But I know what you want."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
A dream about you, baby,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
But I know that he don't talk,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Where mercy walks the plank,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
They say that every man must fall,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Like a rolling stone,
Badge out, laid off,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Under the microscope,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
King of the streets, child of clay,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
God knows there's a river,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
I never can go because, you know,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
In the darkness of my night,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
But, if you want me to,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
The wind blowing the snow around,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
On the stone that remains,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Mixing up the medicine,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
In the image of someone you used to know,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
It was you who came right through,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Look who's back in town,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Don't try No Doz,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Ooh, watered-down love,
We take great delight in our own company,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Made of silver or of golden,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Hazel, you called and I came,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
A true love of mine,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
They walk among the stately trees,
He is centuries old,
Three angels up above the street,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
God knows it's true,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
A handle hid out in the dark,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Carved next to his name,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
With his fist in a clinch,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Need a woman all the time,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Just don't know what to do,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
All them prophets good and gone,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
I thank the Lord,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
God knows there's a chance,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Just as long as you stay with me,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Well, there ain't no going back,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Rabbit running down across the road,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
On this new morning, new morning,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Not the end, not the end,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
And there's two white horses following me,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Try hard, get barred,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I'd give you the sky high above,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
People talk of situations,
You will be alright, girl,
I just don't see why I should even care,
If you'd see me this way,
The winter would hold no spring,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
They say every man needs protection,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Vanished from my hand,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Stone you when you are young and able,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Crumble into one another,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
But I would not feel so all alone,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
I'd be sad and blue,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Day you quit me, baby,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
You were snow, you were rain,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Searching high, searching low,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
A man with a badge skips by,
We'll go someplace unknown,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Watching the river flow,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Ain't no going back,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And furnish me with tape,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
I love you, pretty baby,
In a pine box for all eternity,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Read books, repeat quotations,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
She never does me wrong,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
By users, cheaters,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Go melt back in the night,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
He had a job in the old North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Broken hands on broken plows,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I long to see you in the morning light,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Don't ever try to change me,
If she ain't feeling well,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
She'll surely turn to white,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
In one the surface was frozen,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Keep a clean nose,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
How many a year has passed and gone,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
The kingdoms of experience,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
If'n you don't know by now,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
When he drifted down to LA where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
And you take just like a woman,
They don't believe in mercy,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Advertising signs, they con,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
And played the fife lowly,
People are crazy, times are strange,
So, never leave me lonely,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
It's a price I have to pay,
They say every man need protection,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You're beautiful to me,
Keep me where you are,
To be--direction home,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
If ever I prove false to you,
Looking for a new fool,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
I tried to reach you, honey,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
You don't have to feed me,
You even make love just like a woman,
I once held her in my arms,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Broken switches, broken gates,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Don't wear sandals,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
As I travel down life's pathway,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
So many roads, so much at stake,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Father who build the mountain so high,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Got me a secret membership card,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
And I'm in the shade,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
If today was not a crooked highway,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
One by one until there were none,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
"Not I," said the referee,
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
For the politician's gain,
My dear, sweet friend,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
God knows everything,
No direction home,
Seem like I been down this way before,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Up and down the block,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
I'm so glad,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
I shall be released,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
It's rising up above my head,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
I think we better talk this over,
God knows it's terrifying,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Pressing on,
Silvio, I gotta go,
I rambled out of New York town,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Well, I can't understand,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
Living in the land of Nod,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Father of black, father of white,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
And when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
All day long I hear him shouting loud,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
The cloak-and-dagger dangles,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
One by one they followed the sun,
Relationships of ownership,
Someone who will die for you and more,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Thank You, Lord,
And you make love just like a woman,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
You have given everything to me,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Front door shut, back door too,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Out to the windy beach,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
I had a job in the Great North Woods working as a cook for a spell,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Makes no difference where she's been,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
But I'm pressing on,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
You got to serve somebody,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
But the time ain't tall,
Spent my money on you, honey,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
The country music station plays soft,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
And, if anybody asks me,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
But, deep inside my heart,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
She would have married me,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Stand up straight and tall,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
A thousand miles from home,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Like some mystery,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Made before the foundation of the world,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
The only son of God Almighty,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
All the tired horses in the sun,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Watch the river flow,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Don't wanna be a bum,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
So I drifted down to New Orleans where I lucky was to be employed,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Too serious to fool,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
But, if I will save you the time,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
So unknown,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
You need something to open up a new door,
If I didn't have to guess,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
I march in the parade of liberty,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
This situation can only get rougher,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
Loyalty, unity,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Where he got him a job on a fishing boat docked outside Delacroix,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
And come every time you call,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Never weak but always strong,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
You could look at it and weep,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Circled by the circus sands,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
So he drifted down to New Orleans, lucky not to be destroyed,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
When she lays upon the grass,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
A lover for your life and nothing more,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
But I will be back, I will survive,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
If you must cling to someone,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Is looking for a new fool,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
That the laws are with him,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
To be on your own,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
She once was a true love of mine,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck,
Who's never weak but always strong,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
How he died nobody could say,
Aim well, my little one,
The Second World War came to an end,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
And gathering storms may arise,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
While paupers change possessions,
Light yourself a candle,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Into my own parade,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I want my arms around you,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
But, if I can save you any time,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Somewhere down the road some day,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
I wish I a-was a magician,
But it ain't him to blame,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Love don't have any place,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Is used, it is plain,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
In the great unknown,
Waiting for the trains,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
To be alone with you,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Going, going,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Make promises by the hour,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
As his youth now unfolds,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Love that's pure no accident,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
But I've been hanging on,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
That her father was going to hang,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
I got two white horses following me,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
But the bottles are done,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Where life and death are memorized,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
You got something I want plenty of,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
People going down to the ground,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
People carry roses,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Drifting too far from shore,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
And she'll be coming forth,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
You want watered-down love,
Their folks, they said their lives together sure was a-gonna be rough,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Don't let yourself stumble,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
God knows you've got to weep,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Precious father, loving mother,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
"Not me," said his manager,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
When I seen him lose control,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
The night blows cold and rainy,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
You gotta look some other place,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
You need something to open your eyes,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
The country doctor rambles,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Automobile coming into style,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Early one morning the sun was shining, she was lying in bed,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
For the wise men and the fools,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
It's really something,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Father of time and father of dreams,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
You'll change your last name, too,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
He been around the world and back again,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Oh, see what you can do,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Courage is a thing of the past,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
You have given all there is to give,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
You made it there somehow,
Said I'm pressing on,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Go away from my window,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
A complete unknown,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Over the hills and far away,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
May be an actor in a plot,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Hmm, I can make it through,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Ever since I been a child,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Without a dream in my heart,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
I found my world, found my world in you,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
It was from her ship sailing,
Corrina, Corrina,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Or have done something wrong,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
You can run down to the desert,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
It's too bad he had to go,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
I went into the red, went into the black,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
There's always someone who understands,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Far away and over the wall,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
For she ain't the same,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
When there is no more,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
The sky too is folding over you,
A million faces at my feet,
To strict party-platform ties,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Far away from it all,
At the close of the day,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
God knows it's a struggle,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Well, well, well,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
They say every distance is not near,
You find God in the church of your choice,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Don't matter what you did,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
My arms and legs were broken,
Don't let me change my heart,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
And when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
That must be what it's all about,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
So now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Who among them would try to impress you,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
You married young just like your ma,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Mercury, gravity,
Bring the wife and family,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
I like the way that you move your hips,
They say everything can be replaced,
I just say no thanks,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
They lowered him down as a king,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Don't let yourself fall,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
And I know what you're thinking of,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
With a killer's pride, security,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
I been good,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Just like a rolling stone,
Just to know that you are near,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Gonna serve somebody,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Don't think twice, it's alright,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Baby, please stop crying,
That two healers cannot heal him,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
You always responded when I needed your help,
My love, she speaks softly,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
If anything is gonna sell,
It hurts me, too,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
And not going through any great extreme,
I want you so bad,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Too noble to neglect,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
But all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
First to come in was the flying moth,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
To be one your own,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
Well, I'm pressing on,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
And every cause that ever I fought,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
I can't understand,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
In the shadows of moonlight,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Poor boy never say die,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
And to come every time you call,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Far away in the stormy night,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
You had enough of hatred,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
And, although that we're single and free,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
The night passed away so quickly,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
She's opened up a happy home,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
I got the worried blues,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
You and me, we had completeness,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
The midnight rain follows the train,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
I had so much left to do,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Two by two they step in the dark,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Get dressed, get blessed,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
But, to remain as friends,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
But you were gambling for support,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
And rivers that ran through every day,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Get back, write Braille,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Someone to close his hear,
I'd already gone the distance,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Every head is so dignified,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Watered-down love,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
It don't matter what you did,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Well, I gave you all my money,
I like the cool way you look at me,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I know I can't win,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
A hand set the spark,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Forever young, forever young,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
That they do not respect in any degree,
He won't do nothing to you,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Never needed to call you my whore,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
You came down on me like white thunder,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
She leave by the other and roam,
This world is ruled by violence,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Adios, mi corazon,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
First degree and second degree,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Without ideals or violence,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
And she aches just like a woman,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Well, I may just swear,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
For her to arrive,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
If you'd see me this a-way,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
God knows how to make it flow,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Don't know what to do without it,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
I couldn't see where we were going,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
God knows there's a purpose,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Thieving in the alley,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
You have given me eyes to see,
In the instant that I preach,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Don't let her see,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Stripping away at it all,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Father of night, father of day,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
But you're doing it again,
She's the worst you could ever have,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
So now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
God knows it's fragile,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
All I really wanna do,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Till he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I've been around this whole country,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
You can raise up your right hand,
Tell her not to worry,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Without a love of my own,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
She'll be coming forth,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
God knows there's a heaven,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Trouble,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
One summer's day he came passing by,
To keep up his hate,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
And you know I could never be your own,
God sees it all unfold,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
But he's the property of Jesus,
I'm going down the river,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Want you,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Simplify you, classify you,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
So glad,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Using every angle under the sun,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Don't let her hear,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
With the juice running down my leg,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Look away, you rolling river,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
The one we can see and can feel,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
True love of mine,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
To be out on your own,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
For something that he never done,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
You stole her love from me one day,
Private reasons, great or small,
She got great big hind legs,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
Equality, liberty,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Who could they get to carry you,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Go down to the river, babe,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Don't you tell Henry,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
They pass by so silently,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
To a solid rock,
He got that soft, silky skin,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
And it's like I ain't here,
Till both of us fell by the way,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
The light I never knowed,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Then they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Never did feel this way before,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
May you stay forever young,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
My love winks, she does not bother,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
My woman needs it every day,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Who will promise never to part,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
The day would surely have to break,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
I got a bird that whistles,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
He's the property of Jesus,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
People talk over situations,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Make you spin or do you in,
To know how much I really care,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
You have given me life to live,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
And she makes love just like a woman,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Icicles hanging down,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Stay away from the train line,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Or select you or dissect you,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
But it ain't me, babe,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
It still ain't me, babe,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
True love, they've been without it,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
The night blows rainy,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Seven days,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Tell me,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Thinking about the government,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Don't follow leaders,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
In the end,
Better jump down a manhole,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
I been riding the midnight train,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Going, going, gone,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Well, I been gambling so long,
And it still ain't me, babe,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
When you think that you've lost everything,
You to me were true,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Trust yourself,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
My existence led by confusion boats,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I'll be on my way,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
In his anger and his shame,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
I just don't know what to do,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
I went into the city, into the town,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
I would not feel so all alone,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
That can do what's never been done,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
I want you,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I been good while I been waiting,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Want you so bad,
I can't be good, baby,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
And I'm just like that bird,
I wish tonight were here,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Now you don't talk so loud,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Look out, kid,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
I'd only have to stay,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Only one thing I did wrong,
But it would not be new,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
One by one they follow the sun,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Loneliness, tenderness,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
The air is getting hotter,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
She said she would always stay,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
I have no one to meet,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
That lover, who just walked out your door,
Madams light the candles,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Well, the job that you used to have,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
I had no one for to go my bail,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
You don't want a love that's pure,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Yes, and I'll go last,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
For his age he is wise,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
May be living in another country under another name,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
By rivers of blindness,
They say every man must need protection,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Got my mind made up,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I've been in and out of happiness,
He's not selling any alibis,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Looking 'bout the government,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Heart of mine, be still,
Dust on my face and my cape,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
When all will be well,
Dream about you, baby,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
But he can't be blamed,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And the whole world is on your case,
Stone you and say good luck,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I need a shot of love,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Hold me, baby, be near,
God knows that, when you see it,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
In the lonely night,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Going,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
To find out if she's talked,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Nothing too very scientific,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
They must bust in early May,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Well, get sick, get well,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
God knows it's outta sight,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Try to be a success,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Is it really any wonder,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
I just keep pressing on,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
And on the highway of regret,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Hang around the ink-well,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
A question in your nerves is lit,
God don't call it treason,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
And, if I can save you any time,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I can't cross the line, you know,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
Going home,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
In the little church a-this side of tow,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Don't tie no bows,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
And I'm so glad,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
So I got those worries blues,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
I run right home and I went to bed,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Grandpa died last week,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
New morning,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Socialism, hypnotism,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Father of air and father of trees,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
The joint is jumping,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
With no direction home,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
A lover for your life, but nothing more,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
It all seemed so well-timed,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
But I'm saved,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
But evidently she don't,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
No, nothing was delivered,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
See you fly or watch you die,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
In another I witnessed a crime,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Father of day, father of night,
Says he's got a bad bill,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
By the night and been to some place new,
Don't let her know,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
It's like I ain't here,
By losers, cheaters,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Where I will always be renewed,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Heart of mine,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
It always means so much,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
God knows it's a crime,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Wasn't making any great connection,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
But you try with your whole soul,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
And the point is slick,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Resent him to the bone,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Staying far behind without you,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
You say my kisses are not like his,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Winter would have no spring,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Friends with you,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Holding his club like he was a king,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Don't let her see that you need her,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
I'm going back to Colorado,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
In the hills of mystery,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Eh, see what you can do,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I can make it through,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
To be without a home,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
I got no place left to turn,
Human gods aim for their mark,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Face full of black soot,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
But he never did like it all that much and one day it just a-went to hell,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
I've been saved - well, alright,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
To protect his white skin,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I went back home, put on my tie,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
And think they're fooling you,
The only thing I knew how to do was keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Serve somebody,
Oxford Town around the bend,
To your tambourine in time,
And, if I see the day,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Honey, just for you to climb,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
The day you quit me, baby,
But something has changed,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Maybe when we both get sober,
I just can't beg you anymore,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Without your sweet love,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
I could have left this town by noon,
You got something better,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
All that and more and then some,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
To be so useless and all,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Yet every distance is not near,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Of ancient history,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Why she did go,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
As the present now will later be past,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
I'm never, never far from home,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I got a wife and five little children,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Speaking to some French girl,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
I should have left this town this morning,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Nothing was delivered,
Father of loneliness and pain,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Make promises by the hours,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
A man named Martin Luther King,
And joined the John Birch Society,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
The beat is pumping,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
But now morning is clear,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Carry the New York Times,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
The night would see me wide awake,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Just like I did before,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Well, the way I love that woman,
I'm going out of my mind,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
That foreign sound in your ear,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Laying low,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
The sky too is folding under you,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Alright, I'm so glad,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
A foreign sound to your ear,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Like as not, it's better so,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Pick you up every time you fall,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
I had a dream about you, baby,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
All the silver, all the gold,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
They run a brick and tile company,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
That you'd have liked me to,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Get born, keep warm,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
We live and we die, we know not why,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
You were striped, you were plain,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
That fired the gun,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
My senses have been stripped,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
China doll, alcohol,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
And the night blows rainy,
Every nerve is analyzed,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
All you can do is do what you must,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
And I--I walk out on my own,
To stay closer than any friend,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Come all without, come all within,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
And, on their promises of paradise,
We'll fly the night away,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
But all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Every brain is civilized,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Someone to open each and every door,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
That can do what's a-never been done,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
They say every man must fall,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
And I got the worried blues,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Some speak of the future,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
That five walls cannot hide him,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Don't let her know that you love her,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
And, though the line is cut,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
And forget my pride,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Oh, Angelina,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
I can change, I swear,
With what your fate is going to be,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Tears on the letter that I write,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
And make promises by the hours,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Well, I'm so glad,
Broken idols, broken heads,
And I got those worried blues,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
And it ain't me, babe,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
It's alright,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Just then the order came to charge,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
I ain't looking to block you up,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
So now I'm going back on again, I got to get to them somehow,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Give you my money, honey,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
To shine in through,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
That four ears cannot hear him,
And to come each time you call,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Went back home to the yard,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
You'll be doing society a favor,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
I landed up on the downtown side,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
We live in a political world,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
The phone's tapped anyway,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Turn your back, wash your hands,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
When the night comes falling,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
They took a clean-cut kid,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
To hang and to lynch,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
From their fates try to resign,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Saved,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
"Come along and take a trip,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
And give him back the time he's done,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
I'm leaving today,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Strike another match, go start anew,
There she come, now, down my way,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
I'll go see them come down my way,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Six months on the chain gang,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
I try my best to be like I am,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Eh, singing just for you,
Had no one to go my bail,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Memory, ecstasy,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Puffing on a big cigar,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
And point away from the past,
Oh, watered-down love,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
God knows when,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Saying over her shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
To hide 'neath a hood,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Don't let me drift too far,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
In the turning of twilight,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Watch the plain-clothes,
You wanna drown love,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
I got those worried blues,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Since you've been gone,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
God don't call it wrong,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Can't find what I need,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
And when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
More people kept a-piling on,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
To gather flowers constantly,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
That fellow who never blushes,
I can see the turning of the key,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I won't have my nature way,
Now, won't you tell me true,
The wind howls like a hammer,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Ye shall be changed,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
For all intended purposes,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
They tell me every man must fall,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Better jump down the manhole,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
We never much thought we could get very old,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Like you never did before,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
You better chew gum,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
I get my sweet reward,
Each time we meet, love,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
To have--be on your own,
We've killed each one,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
I bless the day I found you,
Wintertime in New York town,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Stone you just like they said they would,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
How does it feel,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Each one playing a horn,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
While riding on a train going west,
Strangers all give me the news,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
It always has hit me from below,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Of this I can't say very much,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
She's crying like an evil stone,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
You follow, find yourself at war,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
How he died nobody can say,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Like a dog on a chain,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
You have explained every mystery,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
I don't care if you analyze me,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
And may you stay forever young,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Over your senses you have no control,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
In love and with kindness,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Read books and repeat quotations,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Someone to close his heart,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Precious angel under the sun,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
She doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Oh, singing just for you,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
The man in the trench-coat,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
If not for you,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
They keep it all hid,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
She said she would never forget,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
You have laid down Your life for me,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
If you throw it all away,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Ah, get sick, get well,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Some are mathematicians, some are truck drivers' wives,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
I threw it all away,
You've got to serve somebody,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
If your time to you is worth saving,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
The angels play on their horns all day,
And I'm back in the rain,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
High water rising, rising night and day,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
And your streets are getting empty,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Tell me that you love me only,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
He had a job in Santa Fe working in an old hotel,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
The carpet too is moving under you,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
It could even be like a myth,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Joey, Joey,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
And also by his feet,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
I went down to scrub and rub,
I got my mind made up,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Searching everywhere I know,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
It was a girl I learned it from,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
When I was in Missouri,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
He's young and on fire,
Like a complete unknown,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Don't let her see where you're going,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
They--they show me to the door,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
And here I sit so patiently,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
My limbs are shaking,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
You will search, babe, at any cost,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Oh, my-
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
Turn, turn, turn again -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Private reasons - great or small -
How badly they were shocked -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
I long to hold you in the night -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
Democracy don't rule the world --
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
Ten thousand miles or more -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
I a-hope you can hear--
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
Whispering your secret emotion -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
Hava-na-
You will not hear a laugh -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
Haven't seen her since that night -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
I'm sure it was not three -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
I hope that you can hear--
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
With no other choice except but for to go -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Disconnect these cables--
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
That can win what's a-never been won -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
First degree and second degree -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
Havana-gee-
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
Hang out the whole next day -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
It can't be this way everywhere -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Leave all the children home -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
Remember me to one who lives there -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
With notions his canoe was laden -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
Indians camp along her border -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
Ha-va-
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
Havanagee-luh-
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
Thank--
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
That's where you belong --
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
To know where you are -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
I got no idea what I want -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
As suicide remarks are torn -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Sound like it's on a final run.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
But simply because it's true.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
You don't have to worry any more.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
Then the mailman comes in - even he's gotta take a side.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
I'm just average, common too.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Baby, please come home.
Yes, tell me.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
"Don't point your finger at me.
Epitome, rigidity.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
High society, notoriety.
In the border-towns of despair.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
To anything I might've tried.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
All because of the color of his skin.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
Under the midnight moon.
That brave and devoted band.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Rain would gather too.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Honey, I want you.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
But you break just like a little girl.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
The hour that the ship comes in.
I didn't feel so cold then.
And get something quick to eat.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
'Cause I don't think about it.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
I just can't do what I done before.
While I'm in the hall.
If you won't come out your window.
"And light on my right knee.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
New morning.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
People bending broken rules.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
At the sorority sisters' home.
By that soft and shining sea.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
You only got ten.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Girls like birds fly away.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
I had something to protect.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
They got - all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
Throw my mattress out there too.
He gone north for a while.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
To live it you had to explode.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
But she had some way of finding them out.
My face you'll never see no more.
The next day could be your last.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Our chances really was a million to one.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Chain you down or bring you down.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
From my toes up to my ears.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Evidently she won't.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
It's just the old American way.
Going, going, gone.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Everything is gonna be alright.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
'Steada acting like we never met.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Just you and me.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
And it never seemed strange.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Lay your hand upon my head.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
If it just don't make me hurts.
Humility, simplicity.
Trust yourself.
Fighting every inch of the way.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Don't remember one thing more.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
But these to tell what's true.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
All my connections too.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Now you don't talk so loud.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
They would not let me be.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
If you just let me follow you down.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
But you're never sure why you're here.
I think this time we should escape.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
And I'll go last.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Come on, baby...
I didn't realize how young you were.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.

A man named Martin Luther King...
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
Like you never done before.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.

Throw my ticket in the wind.
This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".

Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
There was nobody around.

The branches cast their shadows over stone.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.

Thought I was a communist.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Alright, thank you very much.
And then unto eternity.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Have fallen from her curls.

When you go your way and I go mine.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.

So, darling, I'm counting on you.
To hold me in your arms.

You're gonna need my help someday.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.

In my Cadillac.

That you just did what you're supposed to do.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
It was you who understood.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.

But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.

Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.

Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
It's that million dollar bash.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.

When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
For there's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming.
I threw it all away.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
I took some comfort there.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.

Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
When you made everybody pay.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
You'll do as much for me.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
You can say I didn't give to you.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Chain you down or be your clown.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Until I threw it all away.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
He could die happily ever after.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
And left me here facing the wall.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
She just acts like we never have met.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
And I was brought up by my brother.
Orders from the D.A.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Baby, two feet from the well.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
I's looking around just to see myself.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
To kill with no pain.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Now and forever let it be me.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
So long, honey babe.
You are on the bottom.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
But then again-I think again-and then the-whoa-I said, oh-I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Step lightly on the ground.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
I know the kinds of things you like.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
It would go up against every rule.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
Far down the street we stray.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
See like me or be like me.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
Blues wrapped around my head.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
In the pale moonlight.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Last radio is playing.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
It don't matter anyhow.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
And try to avoid the scandals.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
I'm falling in love with you.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
But there's a slow - yeah, there's a slow - there's a slow train coming.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
We were the wrong side.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
You can't win with a losing hand.
Honey, I never would have come.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
People sleeping in broken beds.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
They found him dead in the street one day.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
To be alone with you.
You always got more than enough rope.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Calling out that he's been framed.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
Need that woman straight and true.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
68, but says she's 24.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
I always thought that he was well.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
It ain't quite the end.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
I did not do it knowingly.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
It always does when you're with me.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
It was a normal day.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
I couldn't find any.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Some place so high above the wall.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
Is just equality in school.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
I would only let you down.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
And she'll only know he's dead.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
His enemies say he's on their land.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
I'm a poet, I know it.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
In the night the price was paid.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
With all these promises you left for me.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
I scarcely feel the glow.
I can walk anytime around the block.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
For me to return to or chase.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
That's really and truly an American.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Neighborhood bully.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
They seem determined to go all the way.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
He's the neighborhood bully.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Police at your back.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Got ice water in my veins.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
Soft as music, light as spring.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Oh, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
For your times, they are a-changing.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Nobility, humility.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
And ye shall be changed.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
I once held her in my arms.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
I'd give anything to be with you.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
Some place so high above this wall.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
And the mailbox is locked.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
Turned on my record player.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Throw my ticket out the window.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
If not for you.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
For there's a slow--said there's a slow, slow train coming.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
And laid his life on the line.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
For the times, they are a-changing.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the--lonely still.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
But I would never do you wrong.
Who always was too proud to beg.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Is when I'm alone with you.
And he was a friend of mine.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Just to take somebody's money away.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
If I ride back again.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
You won't get it for money.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
I don't even know why we come.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Is what this thing here is for.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
It was all over by a quarter past.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
It can't be this way everywhere.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Oh, yes, they did.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Tangled up in blue.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I--but I just don't know how.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Rode slowly back again.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Figuring a way to get back home.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Most of the time.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Just what this song is all about.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Broken voices on broken phones.
And the Santa Fe.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Come on, honey.
If you throw it all away.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
And every window made of glass.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Everybody must get stoned.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away - we're gonna forget it.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Lord, protect my child.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
I got trouble in my mind.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Thank y'all.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Hmm, tell me.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
I had so little time to fail.
And all your raging glory.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Slowly into autumn.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Or define you or confine you.
"And stay all night with me.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
Six by six...
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
But I know that I can't move.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
There's no words that need to be said.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
You're drifting too far from shore.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Everybody that was hanging out.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Trying to create a next world war.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
No kindred or relative nigh.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Good car to drive, after a war.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
I got a woman in Jackson - oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
May you stay forever young.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
I hate bears.
Everything is gonna be fine.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Bring that bottle over here.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Good as I been to you.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
I'm not the one you need.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
And your highway's getting filled.
I'm going where I never been before.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Adios, mi corazon.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
And that failure's no success at all.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
She's in some foreign land.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.

You're very-well read, it's well-known.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Hope you're ready.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
You want a watered-down love.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
I'll only let you down.
Watch the parking meters.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
On the caboose of the train.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
What you'll say when you get home.
Ever since I seen you there.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
The whole night through.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Who says she knows me well.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Come on, darling.
Take it on down to give me grow.
When she's better only time'll tell.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
I can't fire them anymore.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
And no time to think.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
To which a scoundrel clings.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Behind a man's brain.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
Ever since we've been apart.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
God knows...
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here-it's, uh-have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd-I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
But, baby, please stop crying--it's tearing up my mind.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Just crying out that he was framed.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Going back where we come from.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Went into the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
And shot it fulla holes.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
To anything I mighta tried.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
You know, I loved her just the same.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Mortality, reality.
Without a love of my own.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
If'n you don't know by now.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
So, darling, you better come through.
You're the only love I've ever known.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Kisses she gave him three.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Looking for a new friend.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
To anything I might have tried.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
I only saw what they let me see.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
I will only let you down.
As if a wedding vow.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
You got a heart of stone.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Oh, Angelina.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Nothing done and nothing said.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
And rivers that ran through every day.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
And you--you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
I just can't see through it anymore.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
See him at play makes me smile.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
I'm ready when you are, Senor.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
It runs both cold and deep.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
That old ship was a-going down.
Headed out for the western skies.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
I'm younger than that now.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
The words that her lover had said.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
And you only got ten.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
Dollar a day's worth.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
She once was a true love of mine.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
And I need you, yeah.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Mine alone.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Her fond face pale with woe.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
While my conscience explodes.
I stood wondering which way to go.
But the mountains of the past.
Reality has always had too many heads.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
You're bound to fall" - you thought they were all kidding you.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Trouble...
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Hear me singing through these tears.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Means another poor boy is underground.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
When I paint my masterpiece.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
Got to have done some evil deed.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
I been worrying about you, baby.
You break your promise all over the place.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Suffering like a fool.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
She said she would always stay.
Father of love and father of rain.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
Someone I really could care for.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
Duality, mortality.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
They got him on conspiracy - they were never sure who with.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
The light I never knowed.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
That number eleven was closing.
Rain would gather, too.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Or put up against the wall.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
And the morning will be breaking.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
A-lord, protect my child.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a-a diamond as big as your shoe.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
But you're back where you belong.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
As the present now will later be past.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Patriotism, materialism.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Of every man who put me here.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Said it was a bad dream.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
And then go on home and have my fun.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
And I's left alone with three children.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
So quickly into autumn.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
They're all gonna take on down by the bounded bank.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
And keep away from pranks.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
In the palace of the Pope.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
In an oil refinery.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
You have no idea what you do to me.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
But the fighter still remains.
Everything is broken.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I know something is changed.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Heart of mine.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
I'm sad and lonely too.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
I can't use it anymore.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
I hope I'm ready.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
And the sails are spread.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Memories of what used to be.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
If you just let me come home with you.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
We may not make it through the night.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Hoping you'll come through too.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
I just can't keep from crying.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
That must be what it's all about.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
Life don't mean a thing.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
And tapestry of rhyme.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
With your golden loom.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Things will be alright by and by.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
That I really did try to get close to you.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
My mind is breaking.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
There's a guy I gotta see.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
I never saw the man again.
I seen a man.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Baby, baby...
All the friends I ever had are gone.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Every link was Jesus's name.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
I'm gonna get my coat - I feel the breath of a storm.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
For that's the way I remember her best.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
We all know for sure that it's real.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
What's real and what is not.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing - I just might tell you the truth.
And I need you, ah.
She pretends like we never have met.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
You'll never see me frown.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
For she once was a true love of mine.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
She murdered mortal he.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Even the softest touch.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Unless they're from another world.
"Don't trill no news on me.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
For the times, they-they are a-changing.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
I'll be your baby tonight.
And come away with me.
I need a shot of love.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I-I love her just the same.
I'll hold it down for you.
That set everybody free.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
But I never yet found Fennario.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
I see that stationmaster too.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
I shall be released.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
In the brightness of my day.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
And one day he came passing by.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Oh, her darling love she found.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
But I ain't neither one.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
And guarded them as they fell.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Carry for you deep down inside.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
At the end of the trail.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
I once loved a woman - a child, I am told.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
You can make it too.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Using ideas as my maps.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
With the golden loom.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Sweet lady.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
The time and the place that we'd part.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
But mine was a little different, you see.
The National Guard stands around his door.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Just what he was talking about.
And gives it to me for a song.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
All because his face was brown.
He's only a pawn in their game.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Alright, thank you.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
I don't know any more than this.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Friends with you.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
That's the way I remember her best.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.

I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Going through all these things twice.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Drifting too far from shore.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
In fond memory appear.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Hope that it don't sleet.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
The sooner you can leave.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
Until my dying-day.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Leading me, going home.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
My baby stole my heart from me.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
You know the song in my heart.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
Honey, baby.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
She saw her father's body broken.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
Crying out that he been framed.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
What some people are gonna do for money.
The night will soon be gone.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
He ain't-a got no name.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
While the law looks the other way.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
And it is time for me to slide.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Where teardrops fall.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
You're a big girl now.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
I been in this thing too long.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
But he sure left here in style.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
You'd better get that in your head.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
That keep us so tightly bound.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
I've seen trouble all my days.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
And clouds cover up the ground.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
I got a bird that sings.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
Fear to bring children into the world.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
And you must realize the danger.
Billy, you been running for so long.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Mama, you are on my mind.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
You don't have to be afraid.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
To the old folks' home and the college.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
While evening slips away.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
You may not see me tomorrow.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Till I come into New York town:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Serve somebody:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
His epitaph plain:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
But there's one promise, darling:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Man is opposed to fair play:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Everybody that was hanging out;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
All lies and jest;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
About everybody that was hanging out;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Had to be held down by big police;
I find complete love;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
So many things that we never will undo;
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Gal, where you been so long?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's wrong with you this time?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Am I ready?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Before he can see the sky?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
How can I live for You?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How many more can they afford?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
Has anybody seen my love?
How does it feel?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Before he can hear people cry?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
How could they ever mistake you?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Have they missed you?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Who killed Davey Moore?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Can I come home with you?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
How could they let you go?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
What good am I?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Like a rolling stone?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Where did you lose your wings?
And how does it feel?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
For all these earthly things?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Can you get back in?
So I can know if I'm really real?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
What can I give to You?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
When he's standing in front of you?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Before they're forever banned?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Ready, George?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Where did you hide your halo?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Baby, can I come home with you?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
What do you think about that, my friend?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
What can I do for You?
That too many people have died?
What would life be?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
How many compared to yesterday?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Did you respect me for what I did?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Why and what's the reason for?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
How many more without any reward?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Too many people have died?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Oh, where are you tonight?
And one deserving of affection?
Just like a rolling stone?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Why must you always try to make me over?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I seen better times, but who has not?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Before you call him a man?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
When did you leave heaven?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Are you the same person that was here before?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Across the swamp of time?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Don't you remember making baby love?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Poor boy, where you been?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Baby, can't you tell?
Of everything you see?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
By golly, what more can I say?
Why would I want to take your life?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
What?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How much poison did they inhale?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Must everybody bow?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
How's everything in heaven?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Are you ready?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Does anyone even try?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
To love and follow His direction?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Across the swooping plain?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
What else can a poor boy do?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
You have to pay to get outta
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Maybe someday you will understand
But she ain't gonna find the road
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
But something has changed
Its iron claws attached
And then you told me later as I apologized
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
"Equality". I spoke the word
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Standing on the water, casting your bread
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
While some, on principles baptized
She let go of my hand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now you don't act so--so proud
I will not go down under the ground
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
You try so hard, but you don't understand
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
I want you, baby, just to understand
He wagged his tail and shook his head
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Nothing was delivered
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
I live in another world
Things would be different the next time we wed
And those whom doom and death had spared
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
For what you sold that's not been received
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
There ain't nothing in this world
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Somebody seen him hanging around
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
I'll always thank the Lord
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Then came the warning that was before the flood
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
As I stand upon the sand
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Now, a very great man once said
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
I thought that it was well-understood
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
And into the path you are hurled
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Many times I've often prayed
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Silvio, silver and gold
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Now you don't seem so proud
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
He was a clean-cut kid
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
So I'll make my stand
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Now, whenever I get up and
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Roving gambler, he was very bored
And that even the nobles get properly handled
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
To see him obviously framed
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
But now something has changed
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
You used--be so proud
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
How many times can a man turn his head
We live in a political world
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
It's something you did
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
They took a clean-cut kid
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
You used to be so amused
I've been walking around
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
By no special friend
All the sweethearts you can hold
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
And your trouble is you know it too good
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Just what you had in mind
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
I run right home and I went to bed
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
And things would be different the next time we wed
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Why wait any longer for the one you love
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
It'll be with me unto the grave
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
A girl who would murder her own, true love
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
If dogs run free, then what must be
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
So, I called up the operator of time
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Maybe someday you will look back and see
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
How many ears must one man have
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
When Reilly's daughter got a message
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
The crashing waves roll over me
A bed that is never mine
She knows there's no success like failure
She plunged him into well water where
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Says it's closing time
You could almost think that you're seeing double
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
And suddenly there appeared before me
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Remember me to one who lives there
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
And the Negro's name
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Little did I realize
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
"It's only you that he does crave
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
He'll see by his grave
When the roses fade
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
On the rising curve
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
You into thinking you're the one
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
And you see why it's so unique to be
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
If dogs run free, why not we
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Looking at hands for the lines that were
You're not free to belong to me
To give the special one you seek a chance
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Among the lovely people living free
Limited in sex they dare
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
So I look like a walking mountain range
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
But the dark does die
Just pick anyone
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
I don't even notice she gone
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Should I put them by your gate
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
You know, it's not even safe no more
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
We see this empty cage now corrode
Up into some paradise
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I rode with him in a taxi once
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
I can survive and I can endure
Though its shadow's metal badge
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
You just pick anyone
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Better stay away from those
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Just what you will say when you get home
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
But I can't say I sympathize
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
"That I might be gone a long, old time
I been wondering all about me
What about that millionaire
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
I'm sure you're the one to blame
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
But I can get another one
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And I ain't complaining none
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
What's probably got you baffled more
And never sat once at the head of the table
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
You said you'd never compromise
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
How was I to know you'd be the one
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
That she's the same one
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
While them that defend what they cannot see
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
The cause was there before we came
From all the plans they do pursue
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Knows there's no success like failure
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Hunger pays a heavy price
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
And her silver-studded phantom cause
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
When the rain is blowing in your face
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Lies that life is black-and-white
There were times when I was so lonesome
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
When I'm all alone
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Everybody's wearing a disguise
At dawn my lover comes to me
To show you something you seen before
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
As he rises to fame
You say you're looking for someone
They say don't come back no more
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Mona tried to tell me
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
If dogs run free, why not me
Waiting to find out what price
And plenty time for good romance
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
So up she picked her babies three
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Breaking hearts up and down the line
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
You cut to the core
From the start by the rule
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
I'm ready for to fade
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
You smiling through the fence at me
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
I do declare
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
So I remember every face
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
But I feel nothing for their game
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
All I feel is heat and flame
With all memory and fate
And I would send a message
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
The man the authorities came to blame
Taking care of somebody nice
Full of hope and desire
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Remember me to the one who lives there
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Should I leave them by your gate
Well, it's all new to me
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
What you're gonna say when you get home
I am homeless, come and take me
What good am I then to others and me
Con you into thinking that you're the one
She been gone
It's all new to me
Feel to moan, but unlike before
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And the cards are no good that you're holding
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
It's not a bad way to make a living
Beyond here lies nothing
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
And there's no telling who that it's naming
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Where the time and the tempo drag
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
'Cause the battle outside raging
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
For your weary toes to be touching
For your weary toes to be a-touching
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
I can hear their hearts a-beating
The order is a-rapidly fading
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
There's nothing in here moving
If I was with her too long
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
She rode by night and came by morning
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was a-snarling
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
The battle outside raging
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
The order is rapidly fading
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
But then a whistle will be blowing
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
They're drinking up and walking
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Deceived me into thinking
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
And how I know I'll make it through
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Look out, the saints are coming through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Then she told us how times were tough
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
I have fallen far beneath
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
You go north and you go south
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
But they caught him and they brought him back
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Well, there ain't no going back
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
I wish she'd unlock
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
You turn around to take a final peek
Shoot in the back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
The man in me will do nearly any task
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Her voice once and talk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Oh, how does it feel
How many seas must a white dove sail
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Ring bar, hard to tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
How does it feel
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
He's taught in his school
A girl by the whirlpool
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
But among the dead that were left on the hill
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
I chased me a woman up the hill
All and all can only fall
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
A-how does it feel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
And if my love is real
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
They ask me how I feel
Then why don't she tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Muttering small talk at the wall
As the last fire-truck from hell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
How many seas must the white dove sail
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
To make all that should be killed to crawl
He's sure got a lot of gall
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
"For you cannot relive them
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But I can hear another drum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And remain as I am
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Two eyes took the aim
You better not chew gum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Yes, and someone must explain
But I swear I see my reflection
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
That long, black train is pulling down
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Advertising signs that con
Somebody new to beat on
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
How can the life of such a man
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
But the post office has been stolen
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Well, I'm hanging on
The foreign sun, it squints upon
You need something to make it known
You don't need a weatherman
Poor boy in a red-hot town
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
As they rode him in custody down to the station
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
To my knowledge there's just one man
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
I figure maybe we're even
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Trying to get a lead on
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Have died in battle or in vain
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
All their daughters put me down
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I'll be waiting at the station
Their religion of the little ten women
Why did you trade heaven
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
I don't even care if I ever see her again
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
But me, I expected it to happen
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
And the corner sign
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
The next morning she had awoken
He got that fortress on the mountain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Well, you fake just like a woman
Nothing we can call our own
Out of the shower comes a football man
My love, she's like some raven
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Guns and clubs followed him down
Darkness at the break of noon
And she wakes just like a woman
She takes just like a woman
And there's no exit in any direction
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
And all their daughters put me down
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
In the pigpen
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
You take just like a woman
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
That long, black train is pulling on down
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Must meet the dawn
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
How many roads must a man walk down
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And she aches just like a woman
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
In ceremonies of the horsemen
And you ache a-just like a woman
She got such a sweet disposition
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
But the second mom was with the seventh son
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
"Not me," said the gambling man
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
From heights that they could not gain
But it's hard to think on
She said that all the railroad men
A-she takes just like a woman
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
The ones that jump on the wagon
But all their daughters put me down
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Suicide remarks are torn
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
To remember the times when I was your only man
For the loser now will be later to win
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the loser now might be later to win
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
There is a place you go
All I'd like you to do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
There's nothing you can say or do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Every place I wanna go
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All I really wanna do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Silvio, I gotta go
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Aladdin and his lamp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What good am I while you softly weep
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Man in the coon-skin cap
The man in the coon-skin cap
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
How many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
I walked down there and ended up
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
Still I've always kind of missed her
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
When only you are near
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
For I am married to a house carpenter
I could feel a whole lot better
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Alone you stand with nobody near
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Never no more do I wonder
I close my eyes and I wonder
She took him by his long, yellow hair
So, don't fear if you hear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Who came here from Cuba's door
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
And I don't even think about her
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
I don't have to go far
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
But morning is clear
My ship is in the harbor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
You heard me saying a prayer for
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
All you boys better run for cover
The face of God will appear
The wind howls like a hammer
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
At any moment you could go under
In one I was running and in another
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
When you whispered in my ear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
I say, "Why you say that for
For all eternity I think I will remember
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
The lover who has just walked out your door
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
Still I say her love-words over
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
On the back of the fish truck that loads
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
As friends and other strangers
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
People carry roses
And I try to harmonize with songs
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
With a big bouquet of the roses
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Statues made of matchsticks
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Wants eleven dollar bills
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
People on the platforms
And without further notice asks you how it feels
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Don't follow leaders
You can fall down on your knees
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
At times I think there are no words
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
I try to tell it like it is
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Now, you must provide some answers
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
We living in times when men commit crimes
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
How many deaths will it take till he knows
And the princess and the prince discuss
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And inside it with the people made of molasses
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I was thinking of a series of dreams
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Good and bad, I define these terms
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
He's not selling any alibis
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Thinking of a series of dreams
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Well, the ragman draws circles
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
I'm gonna let you pass
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
You should be made to wear earphones
True love can make a blade of grass
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
The empty-handed painter from your streets
But still remains
Glide across the lonely years
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And the poor white remains
And then complains
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
You never turned around to see the frowns
But, though the masters make the rules
That it's you and no one else that owns
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
You know that he has no intentions
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
They whisper in the wings
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Her window's wide open, African trees
Don't wear sandals
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
And, though the masters make the rules
Romantic facts of musketeers
To memorizing politics
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Six-time users
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And your father, to your sister he explains
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Seven days
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
The cowboy angel rides
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
You been hurt so many times
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
To sharpen the senses
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
And tells me of her dreams
Six-time losers
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And so Patty calls the cops
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
With a fantastic collection of stamps
What good am I if I say foolish things
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Girl by the whirlpool's
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
I'd gladly confess
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
To the cutting of fences
Wait for the morning light
That might be all that you got
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
You used to laugh-make fun about
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
I got into the driver's seat
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
They tell me revenge is sweet
Without any doubt
I soon get some rest
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Someday, everything is gonna be different
And, since my feet are now fast
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
She seems too far out
Talking that the heat put
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
How many years can some people exist
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You are there in the flickering light
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
He really wasn't where it's at
Everyone still talks about
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Every new messenger bringing evil report
In the stillness of the midnight
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
I'm moving after midnight
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Our Father would not like the way that you act
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Keep it in your mind and not forget
One more night I will wait for the light
I'm on the pavement
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
The slow one now will later be fast
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
But, if the arrow is straight
They tell me to be discreet
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
He built a fire on Main Street
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
To hold each other tight
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
How many years can a mountain exist
You're hearing my heart beat
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
You don't forget
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
The slowest now will later be fast
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
To keep it in your mind and not forget
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And I, in my armor, turning about
So he never thinks straight
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
By the way, that's a cute hat
Everything is always right
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
With your pockets well protected at last
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
And the first one now will later be last
It don't take too long to find out
Yet you know there is no answer fit
You used to laugh about
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Johnny's in the basement
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Well, early in the morning till late at night
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Like a corkscrew to my heart
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Plants in the bed, but
In the precious winds they rot
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
One more night the moon is shining bright
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Keep me set apart
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
I think that it's best
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
You're gonna get hit
There's some people that
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Well, I finally started thinking straight
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
I'll remember you
I can be just like you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And I tell this truth to you
It's just crazy being here with you
To be alone with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I just might have to come see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To protect you and defend you
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
The only one I know
But sooner or later one of us must know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
I seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
With only you in view
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Sooner or later one of us must know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Down every street there's a window
Well, I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
He been living there three years now
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Don't it always a-go to show
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
I'd sure like to know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He seen a lot of women but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Don't it always go to show
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
It only goes to show
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Well, I'm walking down the highway
So they took him to the infirmary
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
And the only tune my guitar could play
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Don't you tell Henry
And I'm leaving every day to run away
And it's up to you to say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
That I done it the way
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
From phony jealousy
Though I'd never say
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
But I can't deny
So, I'm walking down your highway
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Spouted out that liberty
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
My mind weaves a symphony
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
She puts it to me plain as day
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
The same thing I would want today
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
For them that must obey authority
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
I send you all my money
For them that think death--death's honesty
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
The Spanish-American War had its day
She knocked upon it anyway
To those condemned to act accordingly
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
So I run down most hurriedly
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
For them that think death's honesty
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
And that which you've given me today
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Well, I saw it advertised one day
She smiles, walks the other way
If I don't take the chance to try
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Is worth more than I could pay
My ears hear a symphony
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
No, you'll not now or no other day
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
How many times must the cannon balls fly
And for His love they took His life away
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
A cock is crowing far away
I did not do it harmfully
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Maggie says that many say
But you can never steal away
And the ladies treat me kindly
Went to the doctor the very next day
That I was just a puppet in a play
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
We banged the drum slowly
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Or if you just want some company
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
