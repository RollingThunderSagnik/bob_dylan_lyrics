The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!

Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!

But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Country'll grow."
Tangled up in blue."
And hung on a willow tree."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
"I've had too much of your company,"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
They look as white as snow."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
And have it on Highway 61."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
We'll both go home together."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
You can't blame us at all."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
And keep him good company."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
God said, "On Highway 61."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
That you must always first forgive them."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
But I know what you want."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
We'll both go off together."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
I didn't see you around."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
"Is it easy to forget?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"That way down Highway 61."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Have it on Highway 61."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
We want folksingers here."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Get on your horse and ride away."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
I love far better than thee."
"Have you seen dignity?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
And pretend that you never have met."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
And punched my cigarette."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
So write to her tenderly."
I'll apply them all to thee."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
It's all for the love of thee."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
They look as dark as night."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
I'll endow them onto thee."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Where you and I will unite."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Come flowing down so free?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
I can't find my knees."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
I'll bring back my lady."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Would kill a little bird like me."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
You and I'll never know."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
You must know about my debutante."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Will mourn for your return."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
I would want again tomorrow."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
You can't blame me at all."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
From across that lonesome ocean."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
And it's all for the love of thee."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
China doll, alcohol,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
How he died nobody could say,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Father of day, father of night,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
You don't have to feed me,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Mixing up the medicine,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Don't wear sandals,
Wasn't making any great connection,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
I can't be good, baby,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Tell her not to worry,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
But, if you want me to,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
How does it feel,
I got two white horses following me,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
And the point is slick,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
You want watered-down love,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Speaking to some French girl,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Three by three they're turning the key,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
"Not I," said the referee,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
If you must cling to someone,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
It's really something,
And it ain't me, babe,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
But now morning is clear,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
But it would not be new,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
The country music station plays soft,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
For the wise men and the fools,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
That they do not respect in any degree,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
To protect his white skin,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Keep a clean nose,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
God knows it's fragile,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Honey, I will meet you there,
It still ain't me, babe,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Don't let yourself stumble,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
We never much thought we could get very old,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
One by one they follow the sun,
Till both of us fell by the way,
I got a wife and five little children,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
You had enough of hatred,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Heart of mine,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
By the night and been to some place new,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
It always means so much,
Want you so bad,
You'll change your last name, too,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
I'm going out of my mind,
Ooh, watered-down love,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Watching the river flow,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
You will be alright, girl,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Simplify you, classify you,
To your tambourine in time,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Friends with you,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
To be out on your own,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Six months on the chain gang,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
I know I can't win,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
One by one until there were none,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Father of time and father of dreams,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Well, I gave you all my money,
And, though the line is cut,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Some things are too hot to touch,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
I want you,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Five by five they tried to survive,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
I would not feel so all alone,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
The Second World War came to an end,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Up and down the block,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
The train leaves at half past ten,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Yet every distance is not near,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
True love of mine,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
My senses have been stripped,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
My existence led by confusion boats,
And the whole world is on your case,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Three angels up above the street,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Why she did go,
Got my mind made up,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
And give him back the time he's done,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Laying low,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Without ideals or violence,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
As human gods aim for their mark,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
And rivers that ran through every day,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Day you quit me, baby,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
And I know what you're thinking of,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Stripping away at it all,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I don't want to meet your kin,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Cares not to come up any higher,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
When there is no more,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Two by two they step in the dark,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
This situation can only get rougher,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Every nerve is analyzed,
But it ain't me, babe,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
You have given me life to live,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
She once was a true love of mine,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
God knows it's terrifying,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Broken hands on broken plows,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Thieving in the alley,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
I went into the city, into the town,
Ain't no going back,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
At the close of the day,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Just don't know what to do,
Never did feel this way before,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Not the end, not the end,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Aim well, my little one,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Into my own parade,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
It was from her ship sailing,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
But, if I will save you the time,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
To keep up his hate,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
The path you've endured has been rough,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
If I didn't have to guess,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Madams light the candles,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
They must bust in early May,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
By losers, cheaters,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
They say every man must need protection,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
We take great delight in our own company,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
But I know that he don't talk,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
I just can't beg you anymore,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
I can make it through,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
You can run down to the desert,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
To be without a home,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Spent my money on you, honey,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
And you make love just like a woman,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Living in the land of Nod,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
In the instant that I preach,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
You stole her love from me one day,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Yesterday is just a memory,
It could even be like a myth,
Vanished from my hand,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
They walk among the stately trees,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
But you're doing it again,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
And all of your children start to resent you,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
First degree and second degree,
On the stone that remains,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
When all will be well,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Four by four, no illusion for,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Without a dream in my heart,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
She got great big hind legs,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
You better duck down the alleyway,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And, although that we're single and free,
Every head is so dignified,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Grandpa died last week,
God knows everything,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
It's alright,
I can change, I swear,
The night would see me wide awake,
From their fates try to resign,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
All that and more and then some,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
And played the fife lowly,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
In the darkness of my night,
God don't call it treason,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Don't let yourself fall,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Heart of mine, be still,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
Well, the way I love that woman,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Using every angle under the sun,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
And I'm back in the rain,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Private reasons, great or small,
But I've been hanging on,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Better jump down the manhole,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I can see the turning of the key,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Make you spin or do you in,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
And ride a horse along the trail,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
So glad,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
And I got the worried blues,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I once held her in my arms,
I got my mind made up,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
That can do what's never been done,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Far away in the stormy night,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
And I'm so glad,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
The joint is jumping,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
You came down on me like white thunder,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
But I will be back, I will survive,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
That must be what it's all about,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
And not going through any great extreme,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
A hand set the spark,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Front door shut, back door too,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
That you'd have liked me to,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
I went into the city, went into the town,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
When I seen him lose control,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
God knows it's a crime,
I just don't see why I should even care,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Come on, come on, stick together,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Going home,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Automobile coming into style,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
She never does me wrong,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Someone to close his heart,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
And forget my pride,
A million faces at my feet,
I had so much left to do,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Resent him to the bone,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Keep me where you are,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
She looked at me, begin to smile,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Well, I can't understand,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
To find out if she's talked,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
With what your fate is going to be,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Each time we meet, love,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
At ships with tattooed sails,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Of this I can't say very much,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
They say that every man must fall,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
A true love of mine,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Well, I may just swear,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Baby, let me follow you down,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Don't try No Doz,
More people kept a-piling on,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
It's like I ain't here,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
You can raise up your right hand,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
The man in the trench-coat,
That can do what's a-never been done,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
I thank the Lord,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
As the present now will later be past,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
May be living in another country under another name,
If ever I prove false to you,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Just like a rolling stone,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
And point away from the past,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
For her to arrive,
They--they show me to the door,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
But evidently she don't,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
All the tired horses in the sun,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
Over your senses you have no control,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Going, going, gone,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
You have laid down Your life for me,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
You better chew gum,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
So, never leave me lonely,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
To strict party-platform ties,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
The Communists was a-coming around,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Father of night, father of day,
Drag you down or drain you down,
I just keep pressing on,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Equality, liberty,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
You married young just like your ma,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
In a pine box for all eternity,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
That two healers cannot heal him,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
My dear, sweet friend,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Nothing too very scientific,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
But you were gambling for support,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Just then the order came to charge,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
I try my best to be just like I am,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Don't matter what you did,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Is looking for a new fool,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
It always has hit me from below,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Thinking about the government,
I'm going back to Colorado,
All you can do is do what you must,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
When I was in Missouri,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
My love, she speaks softly,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
He's the property of Jesus,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
And, if I see the day,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
He won't do nothing to you,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Just remember that death is not the end,
You need something to open your eyes,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
There's always someone who understands,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
To stay closer than any friend,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Oh, watered-down love,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Pressing on,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
How many a year has passed and gone,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Father of black, father of white,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
She's opened up a happy home,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
He is centuries old,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Well, well, well,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Try to be a success,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Eh, singing just for you,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
You have given all there is to give,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
King of the streets, child of clay,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
It hurts me, too,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
You could look at it and weep,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I'm going down the river,
Like some mystery,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Seem like I been down this way before,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Relationships of ownership,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Can't find what I need,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
With a killer's pride, security,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
That fellow who never blushes,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
I swung on to my old guitar,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
Oh, singing just for you,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
How he died nobody can say,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
I'm leaving today,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Serve somebody,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
So unknown,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
High water rising, rising night and day,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I went into the red, went into the black,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Ye shall be a-changed,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Made of silver or of golden,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
God knows there's a purpose,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Each one playing a horn,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
I don't care if you feel like me,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Give you my money, honey,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
I should have left this town this morning,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Of ancient history,
And, if anybody asks me,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Precious angel under the sun,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
And to come every time you call,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
God knows there's a river,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
There she come, now, down my way,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
And she'll be coming forth,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Don't let me change my heart,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
That the laws are with him,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
And your streets are getting empty,
They lowered him down as a king,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
They keep it all hid,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
You were striped, you were plain,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Going, going,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
They run a brick and tile company,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Icicles hanging down,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
So many roads, so much at stake,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Love don't have any place,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Like a rolling stone,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Socialism, hypnotism,
We'll fly the night away,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
If you throw it all away,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
For his age he is wise,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
We've killed each one,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Too noble to neglect,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
People going down to the ground,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
It's not aimed at anyone,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
For something that he never done,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
One by one they followed the sun,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Holding his club like he was a king,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Broken lines, broken strings,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
If'n you don't know by now,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
In the great unknown,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Get born, keep warm,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
With no direction home,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
It was a girl I learned it from,
But something has changed,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
"Not me," said his manager,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Circled by the circus sands,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
And she aches just like a woman,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
The winter would hold no spring,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
A thousand miles from home,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
The wind howls like a hammer,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Oh, Angelina,
Stand up straight and tall,
I think we better talk this over,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
That fired the gun,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Just like I did before,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Wintertime in New York town,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Badge out, laid off,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
And I'm just like that bird,
Nothing was delivered,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Trouble,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Don't follow leaders,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Mercury, gravity,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
You'll be doing society a favor,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
I'm pledging my time to you,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
People carry roses,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Hang around the ink-well,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Said I'm pressing on,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
If you can't quit your sinning,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Bring the wife and family,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
So I got those worries blues,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
To have--be on your own,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
You made it there somehow,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Tell me that you love me only,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Never needed to call you my whore,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Who could they get to carry you,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
In love and with kindness,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I been riding the midnight train,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
I shall be released,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Where life and death are memorized,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
To shine in through,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Tell me,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
With the juice running down my leg,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
Or have done something wrong,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
They tell me every man must fall,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
Ever since I been a child,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Too serious to fool,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Like as not, it's better so,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Don't let her know,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
No, nothing was delivered,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
They say every distance is not near,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Already the fiesta has begun,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
The kingdoms of experience,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
You got something I want plenty of,
Look who's back in town,
They took a clean-cut kid,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
God knows it's true,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Carved next to his name,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
You were snow, you were rain,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Now, won't you tell me true,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Yes, I want you so bad,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
God don't call it wrong,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
A dream about you, baby,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
One more night the stars are in sight,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
And may you stay forever young,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
"Come along and take a trip,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Don't let her hear,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Stone you and say good luck,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Staying far behind without you,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
The light I never knowed,
And I--I walk out on my own,
May you stay forever young,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
To gather flowers constantly,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
In one the surface was frozen,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
The sky too is folding over you,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
You and me, we had completeness,
When the night comes falling,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
The day would surely have to break,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
All the silver, all the gold,
They don't believe in mercy,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Broken threads, broken springs,
To be--direction home,
Face full of black soot,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
And to come each time you call,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Going,
Watch the river flow,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
To be alone with you,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
You got something better,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
I try my best to be like I am,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Drifting too far from shore,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
You have given everything to me,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
By rivers of blindness,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Bringing me all of your charms,
I'll be on my way,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Get back, write Braille,
I want my arms around you,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
She said she would never forget,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Poor boy never say die,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
All them prophets good and gone,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
And here I sit so patiently,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
It was you who came right through,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
I love you, pretty baby,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I've been around this whole country,
I been good while I been waiting,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
If you'd see me this way,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
I like the cool way you look at me,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Got me a secret membership card,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
To know how much I really care,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Need a woman all the time,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
I went out last night to take a little round,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
And there's two white horses following me,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Ah, get sick, get well,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
The sky too is folding under you,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Try hard, get barred,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
I'm so glad,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
As I travel down life's pathway,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
Out to the windy beach,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
You wanna drown love,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Without your sweet love,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
When she lays upon the grass,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
To be one your own,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Searching everywhere I know,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
If anything is gonna sell,
To hide 'neath a hood,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Baby, please stop crying,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
They say every man need protection,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
She said she would always stay,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Hold me, baby, be near,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
I won't have my nature way,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Well, I'm so glad,
My limbs are shaking,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
The man there said he loved my sound,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
You say my kisses are not like his,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
To hang and to lynch,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
You gotta look some other place,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
But I'm pressing on,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I got the worried blues,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
If she ain't feeling well,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Far away and over the wall,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
They say every man needs protection,
I'd be sad and blue,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Memory, ecstasy,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Like a dog on a chain,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Don't ever try to change me,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Gonna serve somebody,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Corrina, Corrina,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Adios, mi corazon,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Light yourself a candle,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
It's rising up above my head,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Don't you tell Henry,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
But, it ain't me, babe,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
God knows that, when you see it,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
To a solid rock,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Since you've been gone,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
The one we can see and can feel,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
But the time ain't tall,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
And on the highway of regret,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I been good,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
I just can't do what I've done before,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Is used, it is plain,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Eh, in somebody's room,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Every brain is civilized,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
I had a dream about you, baby,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
We live and we die, we know not why,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
You need something to open up a new door,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
All I really wanna do,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
I've been in and out of happiness,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
No direction home,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
While riding on a train going west,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
That her father was going to hang,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
I never can go because, you know,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
I get my sweet reward,
And you take just like a woman,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Advertising signs, they con,
Father of minutes, father of days,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
The country doctor rambles,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Look out, kid,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Read books, repeat quotations,
My arms and legs were broken,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Precious memories, how they linger,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Hmm, I can make it through,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Want you,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
The phone's tapped anyway,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
In the end,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
The only son of God Almighty,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I run right home and I went to bed,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
And think they're fooling you,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
And I got those worried blues,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Forever young, forever young,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Don't know what to do without it,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
The midnight rain follows the train,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
You have given me eyes to see,
One summer's day he came passing by,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Poor boy dressed in black,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Strangers all give me the news,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Look away, you rolling river,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Don't steal, don't lift,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Just as long as you stay with me,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Just to know that you are near,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Under the microscope,
Searching high, searching low,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
You have explained every mystery,
Go melt back in the night,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Come all without, come all within,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
He's not selling any alibis,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
I could have left this town by noon,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Had no one to go my bail,
I just say no thanks,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Dream about you, baby,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
It's too bad he had to go,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
And furnish me with tape,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
But ye shall be a-changed,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Father of loneliness and pain,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
You got to serve somebody,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
My woman needs it every day,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
And I don't want to drag you down,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,

You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I just don't know what to do,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,

Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,

But we never did too much talking anyway,
God knows it's a struggle,
Pick you up every time you fall,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
They say everything can be replaced,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Don't let her see,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,

Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
And, if I can save you any time,
I got those worried blues,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I threw it all away,
Is it really any wonder,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Courage is a thing of the past,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
And ye shall be a-changed,
They say every man must fall,
A complete unknown,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
I got a bird that whistles,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Don't tie no bows,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Trust yourself,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Better jump down a manhole,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Waiting for the trains,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Or select you or dissect you,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I wish tonight were here,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
She'll be coming forth,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
It's a price I have to pay,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
God knows when,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Thank You, Lord,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
If your time to you is worth saving,
And you know I could never be your own,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Judge and jury took their stand,
She would have married me,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
God knows it's outta sight,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Watch the plain-clothes,
I can't cross the line, you know,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
I'd only have to stay,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
In the turning of twilight,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
You're beautiful to me,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
I can't understand,
And also by his feet,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Loneliness, tenderness,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
May be an actor in a plot,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
In the lonely night,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
People talk over situations,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Far away from it all,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
And it's like I ain't here,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
The air is getting hotter,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
I'd give you the sky high above,
God knows how to make it flow,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
You to me were true,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Like a complete unknown,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
But I'm saved,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Watered-down love,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
As his youth now unfolds,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
For all intended purposes,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
It don't matter what you did,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
I got no place left to turn,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
She'll surely turn to white,
With his fist in a clinch,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
See you fly or watch you die,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Ye shall be changed,
I bless the day I found you,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
We'll go someplace unknown,
You even make love just like a woman,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
But you try with your whole soul,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
People talk of situations,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
To be so useless and all,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Beating for the dead that rise,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
And I'm in the shade,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
She leave by the other and roam,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Father of air and father of trees,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Where I will always be renewed,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
They pass by so silently,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
I need a shot of love,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
And gathering storms may arise,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Carry the New York Times,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
But, if I can save you any time,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
In his anger and his shame,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
The day you quit me, baby,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I like the way that you move your hips,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Someone to open each and every door,
I'd already gone the distance,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
God sees it all unfold,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Saved,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
My love, she speaks like silence,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I've been saved - well, alright,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Makes no difference where she's been,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Looking for a new fool,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Go away from my window,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
God knows you ain't pretty,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Loyalty, unity,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Winter would have no spring,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Over the hills and far away,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
But he can't be blamed,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Looking 'bout the government,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Don't let me drift too far,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I went down to scrub and rub,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Like you never did before,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
The night passed away so quickly,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
This world is ruled by violence,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
He been around the world and back again,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
I want you so bad,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Made before the foundation of the world,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Who will promise never to part,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Fare thee well but for a while,
True love, they've been without it,
For the politician's gain,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Joey, Joey,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
That foreign sound in your ear,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
But, deep inside my heart,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
New morning,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Went to the station down in the yard,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Oh, see what you can do,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
On this new morning, new morning,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
But the bottles are done,
Seven days,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
God knows you've got to weep,
I rambled out of New York town,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I have no one to meet,
You've got to serve somebody,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
A man with a badge skips by,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
While paupers change possessions,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
God knows there's a chance,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Without a love of my own,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Precious father, loving mother,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
In the hills of mystery,
To be on your own,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Go down to the river, babe,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Stone you just like they said they would,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
If not for you,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Went back home to the yard,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
By users, cheaters,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
But, to remain as friends,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
He's young and on fire,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Stay away from the train line,
Love that's pure no accident,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
God knows there's a heaven,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
I found my world, found my world in you,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Well, get sick, get well,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
I'm never, never far from home,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
With his candle lit into the sun,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
And come every time you call,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
But it ain't him to blame,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Don't put yourself over the line,
For she ain't the same,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
The beat is pumping,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Never weak, but always strong,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Eh, see what you can do,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
Ha-va-
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
Turn, turn, turn again -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
I long to hold you in the night -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
Whispering your secret emotion -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
Ten thousand miles or more -
I'm sure it was not three -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
Hang out the whole next day -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
Disconnect these cables--
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
First degree and second degree -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
To know where you are -
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
Leave all the children home -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
You do what you must do and you do it well -
I hope that you can hear--
How badly they were shocked -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
That can win what's a-never been won -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Without a reply I left by the moon -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
You will not hear a laugh -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
That's where you belong --
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
As suicide remarks are torn -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
Remember me to one who lives there -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
With no other choice except but for to go -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
Havanagee-luh-
Indians camp along her border -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
Hava-na-
Democracy don't rule the world --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
Oh, my-
We just wanted to see some sweat -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
I a-hope you can hear--
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
Havana-gee-
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
I got no idea what I want -
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
Private reasons - great or small -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
With notions his canoe was laden -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
It can't be this way everywhere -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
Thank--
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
Haven't seen her since that night -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
They would not let me be.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
I don't have any regrets - they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I just wanna thank You, Lord - well.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
I know you always say that you agree.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
See that my grave is kept clean.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Last radio is playing.
While the law looks the other way.
But I ain't neither one.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
I don't believe you.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
"And light on my right knee.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
Never will want for money.
I can walk anytime around the block.

"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
And then go on home and have my fun.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
Even before you came in the door.
All my connections too.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.

I have heard rumors all over town.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.

To the sin of love's false security.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
At not getting their money's worth.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
But everybody else - even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
And the Santa Fe.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away - we're gonna forget it.
Her fond face pale with woe.
The place that I started from.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
And disregards the rest.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
If you just let me come home with you.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
If you just let me follow you down.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
And your highway's getting filled.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
You're a big girl all the way.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.

And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.

Turned my skies to blue from gray.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Honey, I never would have come.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.

Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
You can show me a new place to start.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Or define you or confine you.
It always does when you're with me.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.

Fighting every inch of the way.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.

Everybody must get stoned.

I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
About an old man that never done wrong.

Most of the time.
As the present now will later be past.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Streets up there're lined with gold.

That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Hope I don't blow it.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.

My heart is telling me I love you still.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
Everything is gonna be fine.
They're all gonna take on down by the bounded bank.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
You want a watered-down love.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
With all these promises you left for me.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
Come on, darling.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
While my conscience explodes.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.

Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
But you're not even sure what it is.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
At the end of the trail.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
I been worrying about you, baby.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now - I guess I should have known.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
And gives it to me for a song.

Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.

About an old man, he never done wrong.

Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.

Six by six...
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.

Some place so high above the wall.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Feel further away than ever before.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.

I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
So I beg you: let it be me.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.

By a guy making thirty cents a day.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
The whole night through.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Girls like birds fly away.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
I had something to protect.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
You can't win with a losing hand.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
Close your eyes, close the door.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Saying wants company.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Soft as music, light as spring.
Right now I'm having trouble.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
I once loved a woman - a child, I am told.
I see that stationmaster too.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
Drink up your blood like wine.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
God knows...
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
And she had left him to die in there.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
We all know for sure that it's real.
To keep her from the howling winds.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Blood on your saddle.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Yes, and I'll go last.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
She pretends like we never have met.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night cafe.
She's in some foreign land.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Just what this song is all about.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Bring that bottle over here.
Just remember that death is not the end.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
It was a normal day.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
I can't see through it anymore.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
Or put up against the wall.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
But the mountains of the past.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
I want everybody to be free.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
And he was a friend of mine.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
Tell me.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
Then the mailman comes in - even he's gotta take a side.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
And then unto eternity.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
I'm just average, common too.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Greenwich Village.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
You're on the bottom.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
"And stay all night with me.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
I don't even know why we come.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
Going, going, gone.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
And shot it fulla holes.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
You got a heart of stone.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I don't know any more than this.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
So the radio didn't work so well.
I'm gonna get my coat - I feel the breath of a storm.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
But my heart just won't give in.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
I got a bird that sings.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Fear to bring children into the world.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
You don't want me, give my money back.
And there's no time to think.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
You're my baby.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Wants to get it paid off.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I'm not the one you need.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
With my suitcase in my hand.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Now they say it's the land of money.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Someone I really could care for.
It runs both cold and deep.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
Our chances really was a million to one.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Hope you're ready.
Blowing through another no-good town.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Who says she knows me well.
Epitome, rigidity.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Looking for a new friend.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
To kill with no pain.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
By that soft and shining sea.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
Deep down inside, you know, you know - need a whole new beginning.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Gal, you're on my mind.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Have fallen from her curls.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
And I'll rock you too.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
I'd give anything to be with you.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
People sleeping in broken beds.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
The National Guard stands around his door.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
After losing every battle.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
You always got more than enough rope.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
All because his face was brown.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
Under the hedges.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
And the mailbox is locked.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
And ye shall be a-changed.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Memories of what used to be.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
In the night the price was paid.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
That number eleven was closing.
That linger in the fireball heat.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I-I love her just the same.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
I'm younger than that now.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Leading me, going home.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
He could die happily ever after.
And I've never been too impressed.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Trying to create a next world war.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
In the border-towns of despair.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Just you and me.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
You're drifting too far from shore.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
You'll do as much for me.
She just acts like we never have met.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Oh, convey herself away.
And I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
While I'm in the hall.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
When I paint my masterpiece.
And they gotta cut something.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Mama, you are on my mind.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
And ye shall be changed.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
When my working day's through.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Or inspect you or reject you.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Till your error you clearly learn.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
When I'm alone with you.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
You don't have to be afraid.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
He ain't-a got no name.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Everything inside is made of stone.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
When I run outta things to investigate.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Far down the street we stray.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
That old ship was a-going down.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
"Don't point your finger at me.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
But the fighter still remains.
And there's a slow--there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
Baby, baby...
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Adios, mi corazon.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Trust yourself.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
For your times, they are a-changing.
That's the way I remember her best.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Mine alone.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
The time and the place that we'd part.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
She murdered mortal he.
If'n you don't know by now.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Everybody that was hanging out.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
What looks like the easy way out.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Just like you've always smiled before.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
I don't know.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
From the little Minnesota town.
I see better days and I do better things.
Crying out that he been framed.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Lord, protect my child.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Mortality, reality.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
The same as my father before him.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
"Get well, get well," said she.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
A-lord, protect my child.
She saw her father's body broken.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did - lost a little weight.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
In the dark land of the sun.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
It'll never do, somehow.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
You're my honey.
So long, honey babe.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Until my dying-day.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
Broken voices on broken phones.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
As if a wedding vow.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Just what he was talking about.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
I seen a man.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
To the old folks' home and the college.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
We may not make it through the night.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Lay your hand upon my head.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
But I would never do you wrong.
Police at your back.
You're a big girl now.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
No kindred or relative nigh.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Got my mind made up.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
Humility, simplicity.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
And discovered her invisible self.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Some speak of the future.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
I've seen trouble all my days.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night - you can have the morning, too.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Take it on down to give me grow.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
But all I see are dark eyes.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And no time to think.
And left me here facing the wall.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
"Don't trill no news on me.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Lay dead beside him there.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
I hope you're ready.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Nothing done and nothing said.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
Find out something only dead men know.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
In an oil refinery.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Father of love and father of rain.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
And the sails are spread.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
You cast your spell and I went under.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
With your golden loom.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
It was all over by a quarter past.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
I once held her in my arms.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
To be alone with you.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
At the sorority sisters' home.
But that's what I am paid to do.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Carry for you deep down inside.
In the pale moonlight.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Neighborhood bully.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
That's the day you die.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Nobility, humility.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
I can't fight them anymore.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Don't look it--like it will anytime soon.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Where I was born and partly raised.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
'Steada acting like we never met.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
You got it, baby.
I got trouble in my mind.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Thought I was a communist.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Try to avoid the scandals.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
And relive my dreams.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
That last night I was with.
I got nothing to go back to now.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Where teardrops fall.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
What you'll say when you get home.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Dollar a day's worth.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
In this concrete world full of souls.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
I didn't feel so cold then.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
'Cause I don't think about it.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
For she once was a true love of mine.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
And I need you, ah.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Walking around with no one else.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
And each one I've never seen again.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
But she had some way of finding them out.
My love, she speaks softly.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
And I was brought up by my brother.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
If you throw it all away.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Someone to open each and every door.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
For the times, they are a-changing.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Join the army if you fail.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
I think this time we should escape.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
I remember her whispering yet.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
My mind is breaking.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
But you're back where you belong.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
There's something I've gotta do tonight - you go inside and stay warm.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
Say you got some other--other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
The night will soon be gone.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Alright, thank you.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
In fond memory appear.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Headed out for the western skies.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
Heart of mine.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Evidently she won't.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Hear me singing through these tears.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
You left me standing out in the cold.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the--lonely still.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
And I's left alone with three children.
It ain't quite the end.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
You can make it too.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
He's always on trial for just being born.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
I'm going where I never been before.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
I'd be lost if not for you.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
I shall be released.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
But I never yet found Fennario.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
Rode slowly back again.
They complained in the East - they are paying too high.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Yes, tell me.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
They don't make nothing here no more.
The next day could be your last.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Tangled up in blue.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
My baby took my heart from me.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Just like so many times before.
Things will be alright by and by.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
He's the neighborhood bully.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
And say you'll always let it be me.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
And it is time for me to slide.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
68, but says she's 24.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Throw my mattress out there too.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
So quickly into autumn.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
I know the kinds of things you like.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
I had so little time to fail.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
A true love of mine.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Until I threw it all away.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Using ideas as my maps.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
I couldn't find any.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Someone who will die for you and more.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
I don't care what in the world you do.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
For the saving grace that's over me.
If not for you.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
Leave no stone unturned.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
To anything I might have tried.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're-what you are but what you're not.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
But mine was a little different, you see.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
You break your promise all over the place.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
And clouds cover up the ground.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Than people who are most content.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Without ideals or violence.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
With an iron chain around his neck.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
Baby, two feet from the well.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
People bending broken rules.
Some place so high above this wall.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
Step lightly on the ground.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Crying out that he was framed.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
You'd better get that in your head.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
But you're never sure why you're here.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
To see that you're madly in love.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
I will only let you down.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Bid farewell forever.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
In the palace of the Pope.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
Is gonna be against the law.
I been in this thing too long.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Finalize you or advertise you.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
That must be what it's all about.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
I did not do it knowingly.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Patriotism, materialism.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
Is just equality in school.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
But then again-and then again, I said, oh-whoa-whoa-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Come on, baby.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.

Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Everybody got to move somewhere.

Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.

Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Go find out something only dead men know.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
I only saw what they let me see.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
I know they're not what they seem.
And laid his life on the line.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
They found him dead in the street one day.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
But you were tangled up in blue.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Valentines can't buy her.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
You're too hot, darling.
There was nobody around.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Oh, Angelina.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
There were six thousand people there.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
We were the wrong side.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
I want you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
That Johanna's not here.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Like you never done before.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with are the things you need the least.
Need that woman straight and true.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Even the softest touch.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Please let me ride you home.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
It sure is right on a night like this.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
I threw it all away.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
I's looking around just to see myself.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Hmm, tell me.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Rain would gather, too.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I got a woman in Jackson - oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
If you won't come out your window.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Till I come into New York town:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Serve somebody:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Man is opposed to fair play:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
His epitaph plain:
But there's one promise, darling:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
So many things that we never will undo;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Had to be held down by big police;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Crumble into one another;
All lies and jest;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Everybody that was hanging out;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Some speak of the future;
Make promises by the hour;
I find complete love;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
How does it feel?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
I seen better times, but who has not?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why and what's the reason for?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Does anyone even try?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Across the swooping plain?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
Across the swamp of time?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Can I come home with you?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
How many more can they afford?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Before he can hear people cry?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
How much poison did they inhale?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When did you leave heaven?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Before they're forever banned?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Am I ready?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Before they're allowed to be free?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
What good am I?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
And one deserving of affection?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Before you call him a man?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
What do you think about that, my friend?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What else can a poor boy do?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Have they missed you?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
When he's standing in front of you?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
And how does it feel?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Where did you hide your halo?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
How many paths did they try and fail?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Who killed Davey Moore?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Has anybody seen my love?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Gal, where you been so long?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
How many compared to yesterday?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Must everybody bow?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Ready, George?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Just like a rolling stone?
How can I live for You?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Like a rolling stone?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Of everything you see?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Baby, can't you tell?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Why would I want to take your life?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
What can I do for You?
What?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Can you get back in?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Too many people have died?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
How could they ever mistake you?
What would life be?
How could they let you go?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Poor boy, where you been?
Does he change the course of rivers?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Before it's washed to the sea?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Just what in the world has come over you?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
That too many people have died?
Before he can see the sky?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
By golly, what more can I say?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
How many more without any reward?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
What's wrong with you this time?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
What can I give to You?
To love and follow His direction?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
Oh, so why not you and me?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
How's everything in heaven?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Are you ready?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Where did you lose your wings?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
For all these earthly things?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
This feeling that I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
She let go of my hand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
And those whom doom and death had spared
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
And into the path you are hurled
Its iron claws attached
Nothing was delivered
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
I thought that it was well-understood
But something has changed
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
By no special friend
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
And things would be different the next time we wed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Now you don't act so--so proud
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
How many times can a man turn his head
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Standing on the water, casting your bread
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
All the sweethearts you can hold
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
While some, on principles baptized
"Equality". I spoke the word
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
It's something you did
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
He was a clean-cut kid
There ain't nothing in this world
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Now, whenever I get up and
To see him obviously framed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Just what you had in mind
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
You used--be so proud
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
And then you told me later as I apologized
But she ain't gonna find the road
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
I live in another world
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Then came the warning that was before the flood
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Many times I've often prayed
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Now you don't seem so proud
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
I want you, baby, just to understand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Somebody seen him hanging around
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And your trouble is you know it too good
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
But now something has changed
I've been walking around
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
We live in a political world
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Now, a very great man once said
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Silvio, silver and gold
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
I run right home and I went to bed
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
For what you sold that's not been received
As I stand upon the sand
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
I will not go down under the ground
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Either from the mountains of Madrid
You used to be so amused
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
I had to say something to strike him very weird
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Things would be different the next time we wed
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
They took a clean-cut kid
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Maybe someday you will understand
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
So I'll make my stand
I'll always thank the Lord
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
How was I to know you'd be the one
What you're gonna say when you get home
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
So I remember every face
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Remember me to the one who lives there
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
What's probably got you baffled more
He'll see by his grave
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And the Negro's name
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
She been gone
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
And never sat once at the head of the table
A bed that is never mine
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
I do declare
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Up into some paradise
I can survive and I can endure
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Maybe someday you will look back and see
And suddenly there appeared before me
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
You're not free to belong to me
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
If dogs run free, then what must be
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
So, I called up the operator of time
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Knows there's no success like failure
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
That she's the same one
To give the special one you seek a chance
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
And plenty time for good romance
Should I leave them by your gate
At dawn my lover comes to me
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
And that is that one must always flush out his house
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I am homeless, come and take me
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
It's getting dark, too dark to see
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
But it won't be over till they clear his name
I'm ready for to fade
On the rising curve
All I feel is heat and flame
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
With all memory and fate
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
To show you something you seen before
You know, it's not even safe no more
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Lies that life is black-and-white
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
I don't even notice she gone
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
You into thinking you're the one
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
It'll be with me unto the grave
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
If dogs run free, why not we
When the roses fade
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
If dogs run free, why not me
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
You just pick anyone
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
They say don't come back no more
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
While them that defend what they cannot see
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
But the dark does die
You say you're looking for someone
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
"Oh, father, you will surely die
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Little did I realize
But I can't say I sympathize
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Well, six white horses that you did promise
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Hunger pays a heavy price
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Well, it's all new to me
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
From all the plans they do pursue
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
When the rain is blowing in your face
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
She plunged him into well water where
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Where I could watch her waltz for free
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
And I would send a message
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
I been wondering all about me
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Just pick anyone
Though its shadow's metal badge
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
We see this empty cage now corrode
Leaving men wholly, totally free
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
You said you'd never compromise
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
What about that millionaire
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Mona tried to tell me
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
"It's only you that he does crave
Taking care of somebody nice
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Remember me to one who lives there
So I look like a walking mountain range
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
I'm sure you're the one to blame
And I ain't complaining none
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
When I'm all alone
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
The man the authorities came to blame
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
A girl who would murder her own, true love
It's all new to me
Better stay away from those
Just what you will say when you get home
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
As he rises to fame
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
But I can get another one
Waiting to find out what price
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Should I put them by your gate
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Limited in sex they dare
I rode with him in a taxi once
How many ears must one man have
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Among the lovely people living free
The crashing waves roll over me
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
There were times when I was so lonesome
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
But I feel nothing for their game
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Everybody's wearing a disguise
The cause was there before we came
You smiling through the fence at me
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Full of hope and desire
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
You cut to the core
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
What good am I then to others and me
From the start by the rule
She knows there's no success like failure
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
So up she picked her babies three
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
And you see why it's so unique to be
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Says it's closing time
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
For your weary toes to be touching
Deceived me into thinking
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
But then a whistle will be blowing
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
The order is a-rapidly fading
Beyond here lies nothing
She rode by night and came by morning
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
There's nothing in here moving
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
The order is rapidly fading
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
I can hear their hearts a-beating
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
If I was with her too long
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
They're drinking up and walking
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
It's not a bad way to make a living
'Cause the battle outside raging
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Where the time and the tempo drag
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Early in the morning, early in the morning
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
The battle outside raging
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Well, I set my monkey on the log
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
You left me standing in the doorway crying
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And how I know I'll make it through
Look out, the saints are coming through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I have fallen far beneath
You go north and you go south
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Then she told us how times were tough
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
I wish she'd unlock
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Well, there ain't no going back
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Shoot in the back
The man in me will do nearly any task
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Her voice once and talk
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
You turn around to take a final peek
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
A-how does it feel
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Oh, how does it feel
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Then why don't she tell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
As the last fire-truck from hell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Ring bar, hard to tell
How does it feel
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
How many seas must a white dove sail
He's taught in his school
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Well, if I die on top of the hill
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
He's sure got a lot of gall
How many seas must the white dove sail
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
All and all can only fall
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
They ask me how I feel
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
A girl by the whirlpool
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
And if my love is real
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Two eyes took the aim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
But I can hear another drum
"For you cannot relive them
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You better not chew gum
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And remain as I am
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
The next morning she had awoken
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
In ceremonies of the horsemen
From heights that they could not gain
And all their daughters put me down
You don't need a weatherman
But the post office has been stolen
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Nothing we can call our own
Why did you trade heaven
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Well, I'm hanging on
Darkness at the break of noon
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
She got such a sweet disposition
And she wakes just like a woman
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
How many roads must a man walk down
But the second mother was with the seventh son
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
In the pigpen
"Not me," said the gambling man
The ones that jump on the wagon
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
I'll be waiting at the station
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Their religion of the little ten women
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
She said that all the railroad men
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Must meet the dawn
And she aches just like a woman
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
For the loser now might be later to win
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
To my knowledge there's just one man
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
And you ache a-just like a woman
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I don't even care if I ever see her again
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Trying to get a lead on
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
But it's hard to think on
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
I figure maybe we're even
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
You need something to make it known
Will not be understood as they're spoken
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
For the loser now will be later to win
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Yes, and someone must explain
She takes just like a woman
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Guns and clubs followed him down
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
He got that fortress on the mountain
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
The foreign sun, it squints upon
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
But me, I expected it to happen
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Out of the shower comes a football man
But I swear I see my reflection
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
But all their daughters put me down
Advertising signs that con
A-she takes just like a woman
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
That long, black train is pulling down
All lay down their bandanas and complain
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Poor boy in a red-hot town
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
All their daughters put me down
Suicide remarks are torn
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Somebody new to beat on
Uncle Rat went running downtown
You take just like a woman
And the corner sign
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
That long, black train is pulling on down
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
And there's no exit in any direction
Well, you fake just like a woman
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
To remember the times when I was your only man
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
My love, she's like some raven
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
How can the life of such a man
Have died in battle or in vain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
All I'd like you to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Every place I wanna go
All I really wanna do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
There is a place you go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Silvio, I gotta go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
There's nothing you can say or do
The man in the coon-skin cap
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
I walked down there and ended up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
How many times must a man look up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Aladdin and his lamp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
What good am I while you softly weep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
All you boys better run for cover
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
You heard me saying a prayer for
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
I could feel a whole lot better
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
When only you are near
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
I close my eyes and I wonder
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
I don't have to go far
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I say, "Why you say that for
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
And I don't even think about her
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
But morning is clear
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The face of God will appear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Still I've always kind of missed her
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
She took him by his long, yellow hair
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
For I am married to a house carpenter
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
My ship is in the harbor
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
At any moment you could go under
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
For all eternity I think I will remember
So, don't fear if you hear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
The wind howls like a hammer
In one I was running and in another
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
The lover who has just walked out your door
Never no more do I wonder
Alone you stand with nobody near
Still I say her love-words over
Who came here from Cuba's door
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
When you whispered in my ear
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
That it's you and no one else that owns
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You should be made to wear earphones
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And I try to harmonize with songs
And so Patty calls the cops
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Don't follow leaders
Statues made of matchsticks
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
They whisper in the wings
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
To memorizing politics
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
I'm gonna let you pass
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
He's not selling any alibis
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I let it slip gladly to my friends
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Girl by the whirlpool's
Mama, you know, awaits the news
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
And your father, to your sister he explains
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
But still remains
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Her window's wide open, African trees
On the back of the fish truck that loads
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Romantic facts of musketeers
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
You know that he has no intentions
The cowboy angel rides
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Glide across the lonely years
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
And tells me of her dreams
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
To the cutting of fences
Six-time losers
And then complains
And the poor white remains
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
You can fall down on your knees
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Thinking of a series of dreams
And the princess and the prince discuss
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Wants eleven dollar bills
As friends and other strangers
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Six-time users
True love can make a blade of grass
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Good and bad, I define these terms
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
To sharpen the senses
And without further notice asks you how it feels
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
But, though the masters make the rules
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And, though the masters make the rules
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I'd gladly confess
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
With a big bouquet of the roses
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
We living in times when men commit crimes
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You never turned around to see the frowns
People on the platforms
Seven days
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Well, the ragman draws circles
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
People carry roses
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
I try to tell it like it is
What good am I if I say foolish things
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
You been hurt so many times
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
How many deaths will it take till he knows
At times I think there are no words
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Don't wear sandals
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Now, you must provide some answers
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Oh, everybody's got to eat
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
And I, in my armor, turning about
I think that it's best
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Without any doubt
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
There's some people that
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Everyone still talks about
Wait for the morning light
That might be all that you got
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
Well, I finally started thinking straight
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
It don't take too long to find out
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
But, then again, there's only one I've met
So he never thinks straight
Johnny's in the basement
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Like a corkscrew to my heart
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Every new messenger bringing evil report
You're gonna get hit
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
To hold each other tight
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
She seems too far out
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
He built a fire on Main Street
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I'm on the pavement
The slowest now will later be fast
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
With your pockets well protected at last
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
One more night I will wait for the light
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Keep it in your mind and not forget
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And, since my feet are now fast
Keep me set apart
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You used to laugh about
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
How many years can a mountain exist
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Yet you know there is no answer fit
You're hearing my heart beat
They tell me revenge is sweet
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
You don't forget
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
The slow one now will later be fast
I soon get some rest
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Well, early in the morning till late at night
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
One more night the moon is shining bright
In the stillness of the midnight
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
How many years can some people exist
He really wasn't where it's at
In the precious winds they rot
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
By the way, that's a cute hat
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
You are there in the flickering light
You used to laugh-make fun about
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
I'm moving after midnight
Plants in the bed, but
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
We can hold up a toast if we meet
I got into the driver's seat
Talking that the heat put
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Everything is always right
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
And the first one now will later be last
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
But, if the arrow is straight
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
They tell me to be discreet
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
It's just crazy being here with you
And I tell this truth to you
To be alone with you
I can be just like you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I just might have to come see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To protect you and defend you
I'll remember you
But sooner or later one of us must know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Sooner or later one of us must know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
With only you in view
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Don't it always go to show
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
The only one I know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Well, I'd sure like to know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Don't it always a-go to show
It only goes to show
He been living there three years now
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Down every street there's a window
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the ladies treat me kindly
A cock is crowing far away
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
How many times must the cannon balls fly
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
The same thing I would want today
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Spouted out that liberty
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
And the only tune my guitar could play
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Maggie says that many say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
But I wish there was something you would do or say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
She smiles, walks the other way
That I done it the way
Went to the doctor the very next day
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And for His love they took His life away
But you can never steal away
That I was just a puppet in a play
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
I send you all my money
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
I did not do it harmfully
Or if you just want some company
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
For them that think death's honesty
She starts to speak, but he walks away
So I run down most hurriedly
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
We banged the drum slowly
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
The Spanish-American War had its day
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
She knocked upon it anyway
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
My ears hear a symphony
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
So, I'm walking down your highway
My mind weaves a symphony
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
So they took him to the infirmary
If I don't take the chance to try
No, you'll not now or no other day
To those condemned to act accordingly
From phony jealousy
For them that think death--death's honesty
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
She puts it to me plain as day
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
But I can't deny
And that which you've given me today
Though I'd never say
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
For them that must obey authority
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Don't you tell Henry
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And it's up to you to say
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Is worth more than I could pay
