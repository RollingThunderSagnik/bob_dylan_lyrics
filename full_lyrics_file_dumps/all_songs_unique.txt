Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
I figured they was in my TV set!

She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Oh, no!

But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!

They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Oh!
So long, New York!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!

He punched me out!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
I've got a million friends!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Alright!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!

Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!

Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!

Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Woo-hoo!

Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Yippee!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!

Give a little bit, she took it all!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Yes, come out your window!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Well!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
They was all over!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Hootenanny television!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
How they ever flood my soul!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Good God!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Lordy, Lord!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Alright, now!
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
And pretend that you never have met."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
I'll see her soon, I know."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
I love far better than thee."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Country'll grow."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Will mourn for your return."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And keep him good company."
That you must always first forgive them."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
We'll both go home together."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
"I've had too much of your company,"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
I would want again tomorrow."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
And have it on Highway 61."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
They look as dark as night."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
Get on your horse and ride away."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
"Is it easy to forget?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
From across that lonesome ocean."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
But we were tangled up in blue."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
"That way down Highway 61."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
We'll both go off together."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
You and I'll never know."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
You can't blame us at all."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Come flowing down so free?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
I'll endow them onto thee."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
It's all for the love of thee."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Tangled up in blue."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
And hung on a willow tree."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
I can't find my knees."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
I didn't see you around."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
They look as white as snow."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
So write to her tenderly."
For that reason I will have to stay."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And punched my cigarette."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Where you and I will unite."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
You can't blame me at all."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
But I know what you want."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
God said, "On Highway 61."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Have it on Highway 61."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
We want folksingers here."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
You must know about my debutante."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
I'll bring back my lady."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
And your streets are getting empty,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Where the neon madmen climb,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Thank You, Lord,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
For her to arrive,
You stole her love from me one day,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Winter would have no spring,
Eh, singing just for you,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Over the hills and far away,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
The beat is pumping,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
With what your fate is going to be,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
The sky too is folding under you,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Private reasons, great or small,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Tell me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
They say every man must need protection,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Grandpa died last week,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
I just keep pressing on,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
They lowered him down as a king,
You could look at it and weep,
First to come in was the flying moth,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Stand up straight and tall,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
You wanna drown love,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Where I will always be renewed,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Precious angel under the sun,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Love that's pure no accident,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
It's a price I have to pay,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
The wind howls like a hammer,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
I just say no thanks,
Something about you that I can't shake,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
To know how much I really care,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
It don't matter what you did,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Well, come all without, come all within,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
God don't call it treason,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
But you're doing it again,
Says he's got a bad bill,
So glad,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
A million faces at my feet,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
You married young just like your ma,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
You better duck down the alleyway,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
They say every man must fall,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
In his anger and his shame,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
He's young and on fire,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
And to yourself you sometimes say,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Front door shut, back door too,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
They walk among the stately trees,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
And think they're fooling you,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Resent him to the bone,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
That fellow who never blushes,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
The country doctor rambles,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
And not going through any great extreme,
But evidently she don't,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
For his age he is wise,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
And I don't want to drag you down,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
And also by his feet,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
It still ain't me, babe,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
And may you stay forever young,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I won't have my nature way,
If'n you don't know by now,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
We take great delight in our own company,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
And she makes love just like a woman,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
With a killer's pride, security,
My hands didn't touch him none,
You have explained every mystery,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
To gather flowers constantly,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
I try my best to be like I am,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Fare thee well but for a while,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
If you must cling to someone,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
With no direction home,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
May be the head of some big TV network,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
I had a dream about you, baby,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
They––they show me to the door,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
When the night comes falling,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Ah, get sick, get well,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
I bless the day I found you,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
It could even be like a myth,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Never did feel this way before,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Is it really any wonder,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Watered-down love,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
They tell me every man must fall,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Went back home to the yard,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
And, though the line is cut,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Oh, get born, keep warm,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Newspapermen eating candy,
This place ain't doing me any good,
I thank the Lord,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
The Second World War came to an end,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
And gathering storms may arise,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
You to me were true,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
That can do what's a-never been done,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
They say every distance is not near,
Give you my money, honey,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
My limbs are shaking,
To protect his white skin,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
A foreign sound to your ear,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Three angels up above the street,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Where life and death are memorized,
I've been in and out of happiness,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
If you'd see me this a-way,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
People talk over situations,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
She's crying like an evil stone,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
While riding on a train going west,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
God knows it's a crime,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
A man with a badge skips by,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Waiting for the trains,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Father of minutes, father of days,
And you take just like a woman,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
She said she would always stay,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Strangers all give me the news,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Three by three they're turning the key,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Who will promise never to part,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
God knows it's fragile,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Tell her not to worry,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Six months on the chain gang,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Going, going,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Oh, Angelina,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Icicles hanging down,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
God knows how to make it flow,
I had so much left to do,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
We'll fly the night away,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
For something that he never done,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
But the bottles are done,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
It's too bad he had to go,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
One summer's day he came passing by,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
In love and with kindness,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Made of silver or of golden,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Well, I gave you all my money,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Read books and repeat quotations,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
You've got to serve somebody,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I've been around this whole country,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
To your tambourine in time,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Well, I may just swear,
Staying far behind without you,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
But I know that he don't talk,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Gonna serve somebody,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
The country music station plays soft,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Had no one to go my bail,
That one doctor cannot save him,
You don't want a love that's pure,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Seven days,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Get jailed, jump bail,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
You have given everything to me,
God knows everything,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
To be alone with you,
Stripping away at it all,
My arms and legs were broken,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
And I––I walk out on my own,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
That her father was going to hang,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
I never can go because, you know,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
They say that every man must fall,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
I landed up on the downtown side,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
For the politician's gain,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
You want watered-down love,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I'd already gone the distance,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Every brain is civilized,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Circled by the circus sands,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
I went into the city, went into the town,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Joey, Joey,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
The wind blowing the snow around,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Hang around the ink-well,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I couldn't see where we were going,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Name of Martin Luther King,
God knows there's a purpose,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I went into the red, went into the black,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
God knows there's a chance,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Just as long as you stay with me,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Only one thing I did wrong,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
By users, cheaters,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Heart of mine, go back home,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
More people kept a-piling on,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Just like I did before,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Hold me, baby, be near,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Go melt back in the night,
The night blows cold and rainy,
And you know I could never be your own,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Under the microscope,
Oh, see what you can do,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
I got the worried blues,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
And, if I can save you any time,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And come every time you call,
Keep me where you are,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
God knows it's outta sight,
That long, black train is pulling down,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
And I got the worried blues,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I been riding the midnight train,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Wintertime in New York town,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Mercury, gravity,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
That can do what's never been done,
I can't cross the line, you know,
But, to remain as friends,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Oh, watered-down love,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
I went back home, put on my tie,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
But I'm saved,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
I got a bird that whistles,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
And played the fife lowly,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
One by one they follow the sun,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Not the end, not the end,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Come all without, come all within,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
People carry roses,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
A worried man with a worried mind,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
That long, black cloud is coming down,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
I been good while I been waiting,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Just then the order came to charge,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
When there is no more,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
As I travel down life's pathway,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
I want you so bad,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
And ye shall be a-changed,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
I wish tonight were here,
If you can't quit your sinning,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
He won't do nothing to you,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
In the hills of mystery,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
In the darkness of my night,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
You need something to open up a new door,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Looking for a new fool,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
I run right home and I went to bed,
They say everything can be replaced,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Someone to open each and every door,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
You gotta look some other place,
Never weak, but always strong,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Don't wear sandals,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
I don't care if you analyze me,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Loyalty, unity,
If ever I prove false to you,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Dust on my face and my cape,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
And I'm in the shade,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Loneliness, tenderness,
All the silver, all the gold,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Or select you or dissect you,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
And it's only that I'm asking,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Why she did go,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
But you try with your whole soul,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Without a love of my own,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Watching the river flow,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Each one playing a horn,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Going,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Said I'm pressing on,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Well, the way I love that woman,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Stone you and say good luck,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
This situation can only get rougher,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
My senses have been stripped,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
I fell down to my bended knees,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Light yourself a candle,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
I wish I a-was a magician,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
And give him back the time he's done,
Poor boy never say die,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Far away and over the wall,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
And forget my pride,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Need a woman all the time,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
And it ain't me, babe,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
For she ain't the same,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
I'm leaving today,
I can't be good, baby,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
He's the property of Jesus,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
I love you, pretty baby,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
And it's like I ain't here,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
The man there said he loved my sound,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
We never much thought we could get very old,
You were striped, you were plain,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Don't let her know that you love her,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Got my mind made up,
Bring the wife and family,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Couldn't even see the floor,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
My woman needs it every day,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Better jump down a manhole,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Don't let her see where you're going,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
How does it feel,
It's rising up above my head,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
It always means so much,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Automobile coming into style,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
People are crazy, times are strange,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Like a complete unknown,
They keep it all hid,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Friends with you,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Every moon is so sanctified,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
When I was in Missouri,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
When she lays upon the grass,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
In the turning of twilight,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
You don't have to feed me,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Wasn't making any great connection,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
You'll change your last name, too,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
In one the surface was frozen,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
God don't call it wrong,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
And, on their promises of paradise,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Well, I'm so glad,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
God knows when,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
To have––be on your own,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Just remember that death is not the end,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
You broke a heart that loved you,
I can make it through,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
You need something to open your eyes,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Watch the plain-clothes,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Is looking for a new fool,
Don't let her see,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
There she come, now, down my way,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
I got no place left to turn,
I want you,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
And the whole world is on your case,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
I can see the turning of the key,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
You got to serve somebody,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
And, although that we're single and free,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
But, if you want me to,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
How he died nobody could say,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
That you'd have liked me to,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
You even make love just like a woman,
She would have married me,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
It's alright,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
I'm never, never far from home,
You and me, we had completeness,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
You were snow, you were rain,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
No, nothing was delivered,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Since you've been gone,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
I once held her in my arms,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
A question in your nerves is lit,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Saved,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
See you fly or watch you die,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
And here I sit so patiently,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
A thousand miles from home,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Serve somebody,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
You can hear them tires squeal,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Try to be a success,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
God sees it all unfold,
I just don't know what to do,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
But you were gambling for support,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Equality, liberty,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
New morning,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Want you so bad,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Just like a rolling stone,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
And, if anybody asks me,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
And they––they look at me and frown,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Ooh, watered-down love,
I just can't beg you anymore,
And I'm back in the rain,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
True love of mine,
But it would not be new,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
I'd only have to stay,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Up and down the block,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Pressing on,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Beyond here lies nothing,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I don't want to meet your kin,
I long to see you in the morning light,
They run a brick and tile company,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
So, never leave me lonely,
The only son of God Almighty,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
I swung on to my old guitar,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
At the close of the day,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
People talk of situations,
And you make love just like a woman,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
With his fist in a clinch,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Without your sweet love,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
It was you who came right through,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
While paupers change possessions,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Get dressed, get blessed,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
The winter would hold no spring,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Drag you down or drain you down,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
For all intended purposes,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Stone you when you are young and able,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Looking 'bout the government,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Better jump down the manhole,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
You had enough of hatred,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
In the lonely night,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
She leave by the other and roam,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Well, well, well,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
The night passed away so quickly,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Carved next to his name,
And the point is slick,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
True love, they've been without it,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Using every angle under the sun,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Face full of black soot,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
If not for you,
The day you quit me, baby,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
You can raise up your right hand,
I know I can't win,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Over your senses you have no control,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
But the time ain't tall,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Going, going, gone,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
"Come along and take a trip,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
How he died nobody can say,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Seem like I been down this way before,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
So unknown,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
She'll be coming forth,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
They pass by so silently,
To a solid rock,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
They must bust in early May,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Don't follow leaders,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Human gods aim for their mark,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I've been saved – well, alright,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
King of the streets, child of clay,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
And she'll be coming forth,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Go down to the river, babe,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
The one we can see and can feel,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
And, if I see the day,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
The midnight rain follows the train,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Want you,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
She never does me wrong,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
But I'm pressing on,
And it still ain't me, babe,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
And she aches just like a woman,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
All you can do is do what you must,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Precious father, loving mother,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Love don't have any place,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
By losers, cheaters,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
From their fates try to resign,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
May be an actor in a plot,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
My dear, sweet friend,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I get my sweet reward,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Going home,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
To be––direction home,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Too noble to neglect,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Courage is a thing of the past,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
But, if I will save you the time,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I rambled out of New York town,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
God knows you've got to weep,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Stay away from the train line,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
May you stay forever young,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
But, deep inside my heart,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
To hang and to lynch,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
But I would not feel so all alone,
And comes to a permanent stop,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
She's the worst you could ever have,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
If she ain't feeling well,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Don't ever try to change me,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Don't wanna be a bum,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
"Not me," said his manager,
The air is getting hotter,
Like some mystery,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
In the great unknown,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
To be on your own,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
God knows it's true,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Ever since I been a child,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
When I seen him lose control,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Or have done something wrong,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
See her in that very tight skirt,
The day would surely have to break,
That five walls cannot hide him,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
You're beautiful to me,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
You have given me eyes to see,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Don't let me drift too far,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Day you quit me, baby,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
So I got those worries blues,
They say every man needs protection,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
No direction home,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
That the laws are with him,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
I went into the city, into the town,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Of ancient history,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Somewhere down the road some day,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
You got something I want plenty of,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
That must be what it's all about,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
I should have left this town this morning,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I just can't do what I've done before,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Watch the river flow,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Heart of mine,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Five by five they tried to survive,
And point away from the past,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I'm going back to Colorado,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
To stay closer than any friend,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Like you never did before,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
The sky too is folding over you,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
I been good,
I went down to scrub and rub,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
For the wise men and the fools,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Like a rolling stone,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
And there's two white horses following me,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
To be one your own,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
I found my world, found my world in you,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
By rivers of blindness,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
The man in the trench-coat,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
You can run down to the desert,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Oh, singing just for you,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Spent my money on you, honey,
I got two white horses following me,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Father of air and father of trees,
I'll be on my way,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Far away in the stormy night,
To strict party-platform ties,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I'd give you the sky high above,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
There's always someone who understands,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
God knows it's terrifying,
Heart of mine, be still,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And I'm just like that bird,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Look away, you rolling river,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
She said she would never forget,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
She's opened up a happy home,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Just to know that you are near,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
I think we better talk this over,
I got my mind made up,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
If I didn't have to guess,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
One by one they followed the sun,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Who could they get to carry you,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
But it ain't him to blame,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
And to come each time you call,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
But it ain't me, babe,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Drifting too far from shore,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
If anything is gonna sell,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
A dream about you, baby,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
In the little church a-this side of town,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Into my own parade,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
You have given all there is to give,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
But, if I can save you any time,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
A hand set the spark,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Don't let her hear,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Broken idols, broken heads,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I'm going out of my mind,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
But something has changed,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Each time we meet, love,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Relationships of ownership,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
In the ruins of your balcony,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
This world is ruled by violence,
A complete unknown,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
You will be alright, girl,
Eh, in somebody's room,
It's like I ain't here,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
To keep up his hate,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Ten thousand men on the move,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
Far away from it all,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Tell me that you love me only,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
God knows there's a heaven,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
It's really something,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
I can change, I swear,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Nothing was delivered,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
And I got those worried blues,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
The joint is jumping,
I march in the parade of liberty,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Keep a clean nose,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Aim well, my little one,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
That fired the gun,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Just don't know what to do,
Cares not to come up any higher,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Look out, kid,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Too serious to fool,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Well, I can't understand,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
On this new morning, new morning,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Don't matter what you did,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
The night would see me wide awake,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I had no one for to go my bail,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Trouble,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Of this I can't say very much,
I'll go see them come down my way,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
One by one until there were none,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Ye shall be changed,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
I need a shot of love,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Don't tie no bows,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
As the present now will later be past,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Thieving in the alley,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Make you spin or do you in,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Advertising signs, they con,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Puffing on a big cigar,
All that and more and then some,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
They don't believe in mercy,
Memory, ecstasy,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
God knows there's a river,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
She'll surely turn to white,
Corrina, Corrina,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Thinking about the government,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Don't let her know,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
China doll, alcohol,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Nothing too very scientific,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
People going down to the ground,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Yet every distance is not near,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
My love, she speaks softly,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
You say my kisses are not like his,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
May be living in another country under another name,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Ain't no going back,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I have no one to meet,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Analyze you, categorize you,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
To be out on your own,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Yes, I want you so bad,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
When all will be well,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Read books, repeat quotations,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Every nerve is analyzed,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
But he's the property of Jesus,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
First degree and second degree,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Eh, see what you can do,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Go away from my window,
And furnish me with tape,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
She once was a true love of mine,
She got great big hind legs,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
If your time to you is worth saving,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Don't you tell Henry,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
In the image of someone you used to know,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Searching high, searching low,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Can't find what I need,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Vanished from my hand,
The Communists was a-coming around,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
When you think that you've lost everything,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Don't let yourself stumble,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
And I'm so glad,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Speaking to some French girl,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
I got a wife and five little children,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Don't let her see that you need her,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Baby, let me follow you down,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Mixing up the medicine,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
All them prophets good and gone,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Get back, write Braille,
Ye shall be a-changed,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
I'd be sad and blue,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Dream about you, baby,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
We live in a political world,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Trust yourself,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Madams light the candles,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
I want my arms around you,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
You made it there somehow,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
He is centuries old,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Out to the windy beach,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
I'm so glad,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
And every cause that ever I fought,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
As his youth now unfolds,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Without a dream in my heart,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
To find out if she's talked,
The kingdoms of experience,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
But he can't be blamed,
You better chew gum,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
But now morning is clear,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Without ideals or violence,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
But I've been hanging on,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Don't know what to do without it,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Like as not, it's better so,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Every head is so dignified,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
God knows it's a struggle,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
With the juice running down my leg,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
As human gods aim for their mark,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, get sick, get well,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
On the stone that remains,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Badge out, laid off,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Don't let yourself fall,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
In the end,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
If you throw it all away,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
He been around the world and back again,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I'm going down the river,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
I would not feel so all alone,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
You got something better,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Father of black, father of white,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Living in the land of Nod,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
All I really wanna do,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I can't understand,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
To shine in through,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
To be so useless and all,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
And on the highway of regret,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Far past the frozen leaves,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
If you'd see me this way,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Laying low,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Like a dog on a chain,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Father of night, father of day,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Judge and jury took their stand,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Someone to close his heart,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
They say every man need protection,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
"Not I," said the referee,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Look who's back in town,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
We've killed each one,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
It all seemed so well-timed,
In the instant that I preach,
Don't try No Doz,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Forever young, forever young,
Carry the New York Times,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Baby, please stop crying,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
He's not selling any alibis,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Father of day, father of night,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
It was from her ship sailing,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
The light I never knowed,
God knows that, when you see it,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
I got those worried blues,
I threw it all away,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Don't let me change my heart,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
You have given me life to live,
We'll go someplace unknown,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
They took a clean-cut kid,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Searching everywhere I know,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Get born, keep warm,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Try hard, get barred,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
He got that soft, silky skin,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And to come every time you call,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
It hurts me, too,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Makes no difference where she's been,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Is used, it is plain,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
It always has hit me from below,
I shall be released,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
To be without a home,
Maybe when we both get sober,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Hmm, I can make it through,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Come on, come on, stick together,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Simplify you, classify you,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
A true love of mine,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Pick you up every time you fall,
I don't care if you feel like me,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Got me a secret membership card,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
That's where you belong --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Democracy don't rule the world --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
You're on the bottom.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
The whole world is my throne.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
You give something up for everything you gain.
When you made everybody pay.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
Valentines can't buy her.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
And they gotta cut something.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
For that's the way I remember her best.
He's only a pawn in their game.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
They want me for a gambling fight.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Until my dying-day.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
We were the wrong side.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
Take it on down to give me grow.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
To the sin of love's false security.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Broken voices on broken phones.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
With the glory that is to be.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
On the caboose of the train.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
68, but says she's 24.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Lay dead beside him there.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
But I ain't got Corrina.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
So the radio didn't work so well.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Throw my ticket out the window.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
Hope that it don't sleet.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Right now I'm having trouble.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
God knows...
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
You don't want me, give my money back.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
To anything I might have tried.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
The light I never knowed.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
They don't make nothing here no more.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
If'n you don't know by now.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
She once was a true love of mine.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Honey, I never would have come.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
It would go up against every rule.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Step lightly on the ground.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
Find out something only dead men know.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
Got ice water in my veins.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Yes, tell me.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
You're my honey.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
But my heart just won't give in.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
To see that you're madly in love.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
That number eleven was closing.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Four by four they turn it some more.
She just acts like we never have met.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
It was all over by a quarter past.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
I know you always say that you agree.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
Or stay all night with thee.
It sure is right on a night like this.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
While the law looks the other way.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
All because of the color of his skin.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Hear me singing through these tears.
You left me standing out in the cold.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
She's in some foreign land.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
You can show me a new place to start.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
Come on, baby...
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Hmm.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
You won't get it for money.
High society, notoriety.
But it was more than I could do.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
Need that woman straight and true.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
In the palace of the Pope.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
When you go your way and I go mine.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
You may not see me tomorrow.
Said it was a bad dream.
If you just let me come home with you.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
She murdered mortal he.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
They would not let me be.
There's no words that need to be said.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
His voice was low with pain.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
And gives it to me for a song.
"And stay all night with me.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
I shall be released.
Your voice was all that I heard.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
And your highway's getting filled.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
And she had left him to die in there.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Without a love of my own.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Down to New Orleans.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
"Don't trill no news on me.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
But I never yet found Fennario.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Ever since I seen you there.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Come on, honey.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
My love, she speaks softly.
Feel further away than ever before.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
I don't know any more than this.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Just what this song is all about.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
And every window made of glass.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Chain you down or be your clown.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
That just struck me kinda funny.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
To anything I mighta tried.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
But you were tangled up in blue.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
In the night the price was paid.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But these to tell what's true.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
You're gonna need my help someday.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Who says she knows me well.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
My face you'll never see no more.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Just to take somebody's money away.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
By that soft and shining sea.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
It's just the old American way.
I'm falling in love with you.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
The hour when the ship comes in.
For me to return to or chase.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
'Steada acting like we never met.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
Mutiny from stern to bow.

Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Soft as music, light as spring.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.

No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.

Please quit your low-down ways.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.

You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
I know the kinds of things you like.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Rode slowly back again.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
In the summertime when you were with me.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
I couldn't find any.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Means another poor boy is underground.
You got it, baby.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Some place so high above the wall.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.

Go find out something only dead men know.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
I will only let you down.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Thought I was a communist.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.

But I ain't neither one.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.

I used to care, but things have changed.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
I need a shot of love.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
It was you who understood.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
Even the softest touch.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
And no time to think.
It don't matter anyhow.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.

Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
I didn't realize how young you were.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
I can't hear you anymore.
But with the country to where you're going.
Memories of what used to be.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
When the night comes falling from the sky.

But the town has no need to be nervous.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".

At my window with a broken wing.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.

Tell me.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
I just go pump on it some.
I'd be lost if not for you.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Life don't mean a thing.
I only saw what they let me see.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
An innocent man in a living hell.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
And time is beginning to crawl.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.

In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.

Like you never done before.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
With your golden loom.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.

He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Come on, darling.
Honey, I want you.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
So, darling, you better come through.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Take me as I am or let me go.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
That I really did try to get close to you.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
It hurts me, too.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Than people who are most content.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.

Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
The National Guard stands around the door.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
He ain't-a got no name.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Police at your back.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.

You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
In fond memory appear.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Headed out for the western skies.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
Heart of mine.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
For as long as love will last.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
I froze right to the bone.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Baby, baby...
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
You always got more than enough rope.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
To the old folks' home and the college.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Going through all these things twice.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
I just can't beg you anymore.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Father of love and father of rain.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Oh, yes, they did.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Good as I been to you.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
I can't see through it anymore.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
The night will soon be gone.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Tried to create a next world war.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
You break your promise all over the place.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
I once held her in my arms.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
And I's left alone with three children.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
I don't know.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Wants to get it paid off.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
In the dark land of the sun.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
It'll never do, somehow.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Lord, protect my child.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
And there's no time to think.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
All my connections too.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Oh, got my mind made up.
In the border-towns of despair.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
I seen a man.
I took some comfort there.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
And I've never been too impressed.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Going, going, gone.

How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.

That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.

Hoping you'll come through too.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.

I can't help it if I'm lucky.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
When I paint my masterpiece.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.

As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
I needed somebody to talk to.
You can make it too.
To hold me in your arms.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.

When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.

Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
People bending broken rules.

You were always so close and still within reach.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Finalize you or advertise you.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.

All the young men with the young women looking so good.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
In this concrete world full of souls.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
It was a normal day.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Honey, come and see about me.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.

And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
After losing every battle.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.

Someone to open each and every door.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
So long, honey babe.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.

Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.

Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I would only let you down.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
When I'm alone with you.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
I followed the winding stream.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
Oh, convey herself away.
Join the army if you fail.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Got my mind made up.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
The last radio is playing.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
I'm going where I never been before.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
You have no idea what you do to me.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.

But I can't get close to her at all.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Crying out that he been framed.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Some speak of the future.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
His mama sure was proud of him.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
That can win what's never been won.

We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
But the mountains of the past.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
You know the song in my heart.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Orders from the D.A.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
I just can't do what I done before.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
The country doctor rambles.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
I'll remember you.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
A true love of mine.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
Remember me to one who lives there.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
If it just don't make me hurts.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
Blood on your saddle.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Everybody must get stoned.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
And you only got ten.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
That must be what it's all about.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
If not for you.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
For the saving grace that's over me.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
With an iron chain around his neck.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
Far down the street we stray.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
I got nothing left to burn.
Epitome, rigidity.
I threw it all away.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
And the Santa Fe.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
Must be and that is all.
If you won't come out your window.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Mine alone.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Or define you or confine you.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Dollar a day's worth.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
I hate bears.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
May you stay forever young.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
Tomorrow will be another day.
And all your raging glory.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
It only brings me sorrow.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
She acts like we never met.
Hope you're ready.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
I know something is changed.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
He went down to Oxford Town.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
My baby took my heart from me.
And the sails are spread.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
And the mailbox is locked.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
It runs both cold and deep.
I had something to protect.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
If I ride back again.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
I can't fire them anymore.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Under the hedges.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
I never saw the man again.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Most of the time.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
You're too hot, darling.
Don't remember one thing more.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
The next day could be your last.
Last radio is playing.
You cast your spell and I went under.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
And the morning will be breaking.
Until I threw it all away.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Lovers obey you, but they cannot sway you, they're not even sure you exist.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Come over here from over there, girl.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
But the fighter still remains.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
And disregards the rest.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
To anything I might've tried.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
As the present now will later be past.
I see that stationmaster too.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Turned on my record player.
I got a bird that sings.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
There were six thousand people there.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Suffering like a fool.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
To know which way the wind blows.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Of every man who put me here.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Yes, and I'll go last.
And come away with me.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
All because his face was brown.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
To see what kinda words he could say.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
He never did know what it was all about.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Calling out that he's been framed.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Just you and me.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
Duality, mortality.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Girls like birds fly away.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
Some place so high above this wall.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
When she's better only time'll tell.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
By the saving grace that's over me.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
I hope you're ready.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.

I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
Tangled up in blue.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.

As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.

Singing for me, well, singing for me.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
That's the way I remember her best.
New morning.
To live it you had to explode.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.

And a-say you'll always let it be me.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
If you just let me follow you down.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
As if a wedding vow.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
His enemies say he's on their land.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.

Waiting on my burying ground.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Now you don't talk so loud.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
With gold and silver in her hand.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.

And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
When he played and we didn't dance.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
Go lightly on the ground.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.

Ever since I seen her smile.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
You can't win with a losing hand.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
At the end of the trail.

But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
When my working day's through.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
At the sorority sisters' home.

A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
So quickly into autumn.

It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.

I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Everything is gonna be fine.

He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
You don't have to be afraid.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.

It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
And the night blows rainy.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.

Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Using ideas as my maps.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
You only got ten.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
In my Cadillac.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
You got a heart of stone.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
I just can't see through it anymore.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
You're a big girl all the way.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
Watch the parking meters.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
Now and forever let it be me.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Close your eyes, close the door.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
Figuring a way to get back home.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
To keep her from the howling winds.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Greenwich Village.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
I stood wondering which way to go.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
And it is time for me to slide.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
She saw her father's body broken.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Blowing through another no-good town.
About an old man that never done wrong.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
You'd better get that in your head.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Is tearing up your mind.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
What looks like the easy way out.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Everything inside is made of stone.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Gone as the season she's taken.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
For the times, they are a-changing.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
Can't see over to the other side.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Everybody's having them dreams.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Adiós, mi corazón.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
I think this time we should escape.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
Lay your hand upon my head.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
While my conscience explodes.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
What's real and what is not.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
And crime don't have a face.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
I'm a poet, I know it.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
You sound like a hillbilly.
You're drifting too far from shore.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
The words that her lover had said.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
I'll hold it down for you.
You want a watered-down love.
What you'll say when you get home.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
And rivers that ran through every day.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Bid farewell forever.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
When I run outta things to investigate.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
You know, I loved her just the same.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Please let me ride you home.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He gone north for a while.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
Nobility, humility.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Lost time is not found again.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
And light on your right knee.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
She can't find him anywhere.
In the pale moonlight.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
You'll do as much for me.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
They seem determined to go all the way.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Havanageeluh.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Crying out that he was framed.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Just what he was talking about.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
My baby told me I would have to go.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Things will be alright by and by.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
That set everybody free.
That Johanna's not here.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
That's the day you die.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Her fond face pale with woe.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Everything is broken.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Sweet lady.
The hour that the ship comes in.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
By the jealousy of others around her.
And say you'll always let it be me.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
On this new morning with you.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
I scarcely feel the glow.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Fear to bring children into the world.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Bring that bottle over here.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Till your error you clearly learn.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
And relive my dreams.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
A man named Martin Luther King...
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Is what this thing here is for.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
Hmm, tell me.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Because everybody must get stoned.
And clouds cover up the ground.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Behind a man's brain.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Walking around with no one else.
The sooner you can go.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
I know they're not what they seem.
Honey, baby.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Just like you've always smiled before.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
And watch the parking meters.
68, but says he's 24.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
That big, old boat started to sink.
Baby, baby.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
And I'll rock you too.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
See like me or be like me.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
I see better days and I do better things.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
Where teardrops fall.
"Get well, get well," said she.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Is gonna be against the law.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
To which a scoundrel clings.
And your golden loom.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
No kindred or relative nigh.
I don't even know why we come.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Someone who will die for you and more.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
They found him dead in the street one day.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
I'm not the one you need.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Even before you came in the door.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
You're my baby.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
In an oil refinery.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Never been so easy or so slow.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
Funny way to start a picnic.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
If you throw it all away.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Without this love that we call ours.
Gonna serve somebody.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.

You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
Every link was Jesus's name.

Nothing done and nothing said.

Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
And shot it fulla holes.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
And keep away from pranks.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
I'll only let you down.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.

Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.

From my toes up to my ears.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.

I didn't mean to make you so sad.
Everything is gonna be alright.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
I want you.

I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
I was sitting down thinking of you.

'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.

You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
It always does when you're with me.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.

Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
You're the only love I've ever known.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
And left me here facing the wall.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
But mine was a little different, you see.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.

But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
I did not do it knowingly.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Unless they're from another world.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
People sleeping in broken beds.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
My love winks, she does not bother.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
And I'll go last.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
Gal, you're on my mind.
"And light on my right knee.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.

You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
And laid his life on the line.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
We may not make it through the night.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.

I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Someone I really could care for.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Billy, you been running for so long.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Patriotism, materialism.
Put me outta doors.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
I'm younger than that now.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
And I need you, ah, yeah.
And I need you, ah.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Neighborhood bully.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
And all I see are dark eyes.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
Our chances really was a million to one.
Magic in a magical land.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Have fallen from her curls.
Trying to create a next world war.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
And ye shall be changed.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Evidently she won't.
Trust yourself.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
The same as my father before him.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Under the midnight moon.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Friends with you.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Leading me, going home.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
And guarded them as they fell.
Baby, please come home.
With my suitcase in my hand.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
To make me think I'm wrong.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
And he was a friend of mine.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Where I was born and partly raised.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
From the little Minnesota town.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Mortality, reality.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Till I come into New York town:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Yeah, serve somebody:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
His epitaph plain:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Serve somebody:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Man is opposed to fair play:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
But there's one promise, darling:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Had to be held down by big police;
Some speak of the future;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Make promises by the hour;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
I find complete love;
About everybody that was hanging out;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
All lies and jest;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
So many things that we never will undo;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Crumble into one another;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;

Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Across the swamp of time?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Has anybody seen my love?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Before they're forever banned?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
And how does it feel?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And one deserving of affection?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Why must you always try to make me over?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
To love and follow His direction?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
How much poison did they inhale?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Have they missed you?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
How many more can they afford?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What can I give to You?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Who killed Davey Moore?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
What good am I?
Just like a rolling stone?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Before he can hear people cry?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Gal, where you been so long?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
How could they let you go?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
When he's standing in front of you?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
But am I still dreaming yet?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Where did you lose your wings?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Is it rolling, Bob?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Can you get back in?
What would life be?
Where did you hide your halo?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Did you respect me for what I did?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
How can you say he will haunt you?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
How many more without any reward?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Are you the same person that was here before?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Why would I want to take your life?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
How many compared to yesterday?
For all these earthly things?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Does anyone even try?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Of everything you see?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Am I ready?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Before he can see the sky?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Why and what's the reason for?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Baby, can't you tell?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Across the swooping plain?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
How can I live for You?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Are you ready?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Who's gonna let it roll?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Poor boy, where you been?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
How's everything in heaven?
Can I come home with you?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Like a rolling stone?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Oh, so why not you and me?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
How does it feel?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Oh, where are you tonight?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
That too many people have died?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
What can I do for You?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Before you call him a man?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
What's wrong with you this time?
By golly, what more can I say?
What else can a poor boy do?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Baby, can I come home with you?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
How could they ever mistake you?
Must everybody bow?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
When did you leave heaven?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Too many people have died?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
He was a clean-cut kid
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
She let go of my hand
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And your trouble is you know it too good
But all that suffering was not to be compared
And that even the nobles get properly handled
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
There ain't nothing in this world
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
To see him obviously framed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Nothing was delivered
I run right home and I went to bed
I will not go down under the ground
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
I had to say something to strike him very weird
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
I want you, baby, just to understand
"Equality". I spoke the word
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And then you told me later as I apologized
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
I've been walking around
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
I live in another world
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
But something has changed
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
We live in a political world
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I still can remember the way that you smiled
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Maybe someday you will understand
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Just what you had in mind
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And those whom doom and death had spared
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
He wagged his tail and shook his head
You used––be so proud
Now you don't act so––so proud
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
So I'll make my stand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
How many times can a man turn his head
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
While some, on principles baptized
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
For what you sold that's not been received
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Now, whenever I get up and
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Now, a very great man once said
But now something has changed
Its iron claws attached
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I thought that it was well-understood
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Now you don't seem so proud
And into the path you are hurled
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
They took a clean-cut kid
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
All the sweethearts you can hold
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
It's something you did
And things would be different the next time we wed
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
By no special friend
I'll always thank the Lord
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Things would be different the next time we wed
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Standing on the water, casting your bread
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
But she ain't gonna find the road
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
You used to be so amused
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
As I stand upon the sand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Silvio, silver and gold
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Many times I've often prayed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Somebody seen him hanging around
And suddenly there appeared before me
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
And you see why it's so unique to be
But it won't be over till they clear his name
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Remember me to the one who lives there
And I would send a message
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
It's getting dark, too dark to see
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
So up she picked her babies three
How many ears must one man have
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
At dawn my lover comes to me
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Where I could watch her waltz for free
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Well, six white horses that you did promise
But I can't say I sympathize
Among the lovely people living free
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
"It's only you that he does crave
Knows there's no success like failure
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
What you're gonna say when you get home
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Should I put them by your gate
Full of hope and desire
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
You smiling through the fence at me
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Mona tried to tell me
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
You said you'd never compromise
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Waiting to find out what price
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
What about that millionaire
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
And the Negro's name
All I feel is heat and flame
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
I rode with him in a taxi once
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Taking care of somebody nice
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
But the dark does die
The man the authorities came to blame
And I'm just the same as anyone else
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
On the rising curve
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
You know, it's not even safe no more
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Hunger pays a heavy price
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
She been gone
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
And never sat once at the head of the table
He'll see by his grave
You just pick anyone
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
A bed that is never mine
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
And I ain't complaining none
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
They say don't come back no more
And her silver-studded phantom cause
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Should I leave them by your gate
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
What's probably got you baffled more
Everybody's wearing a disguise
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
You cut to the core
With all memory and fate
From all the plans they do pursue
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
What good am I then to others and me
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
You're not free to belong to me
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Leaving men wholly, totally free
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
There were times when I was so lonesome
When the rain is blowing in your face
I'm ready for to fade
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
We see this empty cage now corrode
Though its shadow's metal badge
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
I don't even notice she gone
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
But I can get another one
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Limited in sex they dare
So I look like a walking mountain range
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
While them that defend what they cannot see
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
To show you something you seen before
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Remember me to one who lives there
When Reilly's daughter got a message
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
So, I called up the operator of time
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Better stay away from those
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
It'll be with me unto the grave
Well, it's all new to me
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
If dogs run free, why not we
Up into some paradise
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
If dogs run free, why not me
That she's the same one
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
She knows there's no success like failure
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
You into thinking you're the one
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
If dogs run free, then what must be
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
She plunged him into well water where
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
As he rises to fame
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
The crashing waves roll over me
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
The cause was there before we came
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
When I'm all alone
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Looking at hands for the lines that were
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
And plenty time for good romance
Lies that life is black-and-white
I am homeless, come and take me
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
I do declare
You say you're looking for someone
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
See the primitive wallflower freeze
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
When the roses fade
I'm sure you're the one to blame
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Just pick anyone
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
From the start by the rule
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Just what you will say when you get home
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Feel to moan, but unlike before
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
"That I might be gone a long, old time
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
It's all new to me
Says it's closing time
How was I to know you'd be the one
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
I been wondering all about me
To give the special one you seek a chance
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Con you into thinking that you're the one
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
I can survive and I can endure
Little did I realize
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
So I remember every face
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
But I feel nothing for their game
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Deceived me into thinking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Well, I set my monkey on the log
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
What am I saying? What am I knowing
The order is rapidly fading
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
It's not a bad way to make a living
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
And the cards are no good that you're holding
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
If I was with her too long
For your weary toes to be a-touching
There's nothing in here moving
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
'Cause the battle outside raging
I know that you know that I know that you show something
But then a whistle will be blowing
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Where the time and the tempo drag
And there's no telling who that it's naming
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
For your weary toes to be touching
She rode by night and came by morning
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Beyond here lies nothing
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
They're drinking up and walking
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
The order is a-rapidly fading
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
The battle outside raging
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And how I know I'll make it through
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
You go north and you go south
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Look out, the saints are coming through
Then she told us how times were tough
I have fallen far beneath
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
The man in me will do nearly any task
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Her voice once and talk
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Shoot in the back
You turn around to take a final peek
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Well, there ain't no going back
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
But they caught him and they brought him back
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
I wish she'd unlock
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
As the last fire-truck from hell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
He's sure got a lot of gall
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
To make all that should be killed to crawl
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And if my love is real
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
A-how does it feel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Ring bell, hard to tell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Ring bar, hard to tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Oh, how does it feel
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
A girl by the whirlpool
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Well, if I die on top of the hill
How many seas must a white dove sail
All and all can only fall
They ask me how I feel
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
I chased me a woman up the hill
How does it feel
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Muttering small talk at the wall
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
He's taught in his school
Then why don't she tell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
How many seas must the white dove sail
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But I can hear another drum
You better not chew gum
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Two eyes took the aim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
"For you cannot relive them
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
And remain as I am
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
She got such a sweet disposition
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Darkness at the break of noon
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Please don't let on that you knew me when
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Uncle Rat went running downtown
And you ache a-just like a woman
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
You need something to make it known
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
To remember the times when I was your only man
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
The ones that jump on the wagon
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Nothing we can call our own
Yet I swear I see my reflection
As they rode him in custody down to the station
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Must meet the dawn
How many roads must a man walk down
Yes, and someone must explain
Out of the shower comes a football man
All their daughters put me down
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
And there's no exit in any direction
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
And she aches just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling on down
But I swear I see my reflection
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Well, you fake just like a woman
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
For the loser now will be later to win
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
As you sit on the box you keep him in
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Well, I'm hanging on
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
But the post office has been stolen
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Poor boy in a red-hot town
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Why did you trade heaven
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
And all their daughters put me down
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
For the loser now might be later to win
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
She said that all the railroad men
The next morning she had awoken
Their religion of the little ten women
Somebody new to beat on
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
How can the life of such a man
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Suicide remarks are torn
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
But the second mother was with the seventh son
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
All lay down their bandanas and complain
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
To my knowledge there's just one man
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Advertising signs that con
And she wakes just like a woman
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
He got that fortress on the mountain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
I figure maybe we're even
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Trying to get a lead on
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
"Not me," said the gambling man
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I'll be waiting at the station
She takes just like a woman
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
But me, I expected it to happen
In the pigpen
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
And the corner sign
Guns and clubs followed him down
From heights that they could not gain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
But the second mom was with the seventh son
But it's hard to think on
A-she takes just like a woman
That long, black train is pulling down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Have died in battle or in vain
My love, she's like some raven
You take just like a woman
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
You don't need a weatherman
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
But all their daughters put me down
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Silvio, I gotta go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
There is a place you go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Every place I wanna go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
There's nothing you can say or do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
All I really wanna do
All I'd like you to do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
How many times must a man look up
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
The man in the coon-skin cap
What good am I while you softly weep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Aladdin and his lamp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
I walked down there and ended up
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
All you boys better run for cover
Alone you stand with nobody near
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
And I don't even think about her
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
I don't have to go far
At any moment you could go under
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Who came here from Cuba's door
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
You heard me saying a prayer for
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
My ship is in the harbor
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
The face of God will appear
So, don't fear if you hear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
In one I was running and in another
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
But morning is clear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
When only you are near
Still I say her love-words over
The lover who has just walked out your door
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
When you whispered in my ear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
For all eternity I think I will remember
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I could feel a whole lot better
I say, "Why you say that for
I close my eyes and I wonder
She took him by his long, yellow hair
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Still I've always kind of missed her
The wind howls like a hammer
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
For I am married to a house carpenter
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Never no more do I wonder
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
I'm gonna let you pass
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And then complains
Good and bad, I define these terms
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Statues made of matchsticks
And the poor white remains
On the back of the fish truck that loads
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
True love can make a blade of grass
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
As friends and other strangers
At times I think there are no words
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
To sharpen the senses
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I let it slip gladly to my friends
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Her window's wide open, African trees
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
He's not selling any alibis
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
To the cutting of fences
With a big bouquet of the roses
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
People carry roses
Don't wear sandals
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
I was thinking of a series of dreams
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
How many deaths will it take till he knows
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Girl by the whirlpool's
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
That it's you and no one else that owns
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And inside it with the people made of molasses
And without further notice asks you how it feels
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
And so Patty calls the cops
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Thinking of a series of dreams
You never turned around to see the frowns
People on the platforms
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
I try to tell it like it is
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Romantic facts of musketeers
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
You know that he has no intentions
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Now, you must provide some answers
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You can fall down on your knees
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Wants eleven dollar bills
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Don't follow leaders
And tells me of her dreams
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Six-time users
Well, the ragman draws circles
To memorizing politics
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
But still remains
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
They whisper in the wings
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Seven days
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
And the princess and the prince discuss
You been hurt so many times
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
"Not me," said the man whose fists
What good am I if I say foolish things
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
You should be made to wear earphones
The cowboy angel rides
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And, though the masters make the rules
We living in times when men commit crimes
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And your father, to your sister he explains
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And I try to harmonize with songs
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
But, though the masters make the rules
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Glide across the lonely years
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I'd gladly confess
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Six-time losers
How many years can a mountain exist
Our Father would not like the way that you act
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
So he never thinks straight
Talking that the heat put
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
With your pockets well protected at last
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
How many years can some people exist
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
It don't take too long to find out
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Wait for the morning light
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Keep it in your mind and not forget
In the stillness of the midnight
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
One more night I will wait for the light
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
He built a fire on Main Street
Everyone still talks about
By the way, that's a cute hat
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
They tell me revenge is sweet
The slow one now will later be fast
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
There's some people that
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Yet you know there is no answer fit
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
One more night the moon is shining bright
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Everything is always right
And, since my feet are now fast
You're gonna get hit
I'm on the pavement
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I think that it's best
Someday, everything is gonna be different
They tell me to be discreet
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Without any doubt
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
That might be all that you got
I'm moving after midnight
Plants in the bed, but
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Keep me set apart
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
You used to laugh about
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
We can hold up a toast if we meet
In the precious winds they rot
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
The slowest now will later be fast
She seems too far out
And I, in my armor, turning about
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
You don't forget
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Well, I finally started thinking straight
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
I soon get some rest
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
And the first one now will later be last
You used to laugh–make fun about
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
He really wasn't where it's at
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Johnny's in the basement
You're hearing my heart beat
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
You are there in the flickering light
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
But, if the arrow is straight
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
To hold each other tight
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
I got into the driver's seat
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
I'll remember you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And I tell this truth to you
To be alone with you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I just might have to come see you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
It's just crazy being here with you
With only you in view
Well, I'd sure like to know
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
The only one I know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Don't it always a-go to show
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
It only goes to show
Sooner or later one of us must know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
He been living there three years now
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
I'd sure like to know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
But sooner or later one of us must know
Down every street there's a window
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Don't it always go to show
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
But you can never steal away
A cock is crowing far away
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
But I can't deny
No, you'll not now or no other day
And it's up to you to say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Well, I'm walking down the highway
How many times must the cannon balls fly
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
I did not do it harmfully
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
For them that think death––death's honesty
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Spouted out that liberty
Don't you tell Henry
But I wish there was something you would do or say
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Though I'd never say
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
My mind weaves a symphony
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
For them that must obey authority
To those condemned to act accordingly
And the only tune my guitar could play
Went to the doctor the very next day
The Spanish-American War had its day
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
So, I'm walking down your highway
She smiles, walks the other way
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
And the ladies treat me kindly
If I don't take the chance to try
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Or if you just want some company
He made the bells of freedom ring today
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Is worth more than I could pay
So they took him to the infirmary
She puts it to me plain as day
I send you all my money
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
We banged the drum slowly
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
For them that think death's honesty
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
And for His love they took His life away
My ears hear a symphony
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
So I run down most hurriedly
She knocked upon it anyway
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Maggie says that many say
That I done it the way
That I was just a puppet in a play
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
And that which you've given me today
The same thing I would want today
From phony jealousy
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Hava–na–
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Remember me to one who lives there –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Ha–va–
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
How badly they were shocked –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Havanagee–luh–
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
With no other choice except but for to go –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
With notions his canoe was laden –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
To know where you are –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Oh, my–
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Havana–gee–
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
You will not hear a laugh –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
First degree and second degree –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Private reasons – great or small –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Indians camp along her border –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Disconnect these cables––
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Leave all the children home –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Hang out the whole next day –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
I got no idea what I want –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
I long to hold you in the night –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I hope that you can hear––
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I'm sure it was not three –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
I a-hope you can hear––
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
