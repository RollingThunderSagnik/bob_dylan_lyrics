Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
I figured they was in my TV set!
He punched me out!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Oh!
This place don't make sense to me no more!

Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!

Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Alright, now!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Lordy, Lord!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Dignity never been photographed!

Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Oh, no!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Howdy, East Orange!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Looking for my lo and behold!
I got the freight train blues!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Wowee! Pretty scary!

So long, New York!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
They was all over!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Yeah, man!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Yippee!
Goodnight!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!

Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!

Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
My God, they killed Him!
Good God!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
It was the mailman!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Start over!
Betty Ross!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!

Woo-hoo!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Dance!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Oh, yeah!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
We want folksingers here."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
We'll both go off together."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
You and I'll never know."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
They look as dark as night."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
I'll bring back my lady."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
I would want again tomorrow."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"I've had too much of your company,"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
I didn't see you around."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
You can't blame me at all."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
That you must always first forgive them."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
I can't find my knees."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Would kill a little bird like me."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
And punched my cigarette."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
We'll both go home together."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
They look as white as snow."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"That way down Highway 61."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
"Is it easy to forget?"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
Country'll grow."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
Where you and I will unite."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Will mourn for your return."
And keep him good company."
And hung on a willow tree."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
You must know about my debutante."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Tangled up in blue."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
It's all for the love of thee."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
But I know what you want."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
And pretend that you never have met."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Have it on Highway 61."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
And it's all for the love of thee."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
You can't blame us at all."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Come flowing down so free?"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
And have it on Highway 61."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I love far better than thee."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
But we were tangled up in blue."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
So write to her tenderly."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Has kindly assisted me home."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
While paupers change possessions,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
I been riding the midnight train,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
In the instant that I preach,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
The Communists was a-coming around,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
At the close of the day,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Watch the plain-clothes,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Read books and repeat quotations,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
But I'm pressing on,
Poor boy never say die,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Nothing too very scientific,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
It still ain't me, babe,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
I can't be good, baby,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Don't let her see where you're going,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Ooh, watered-down love,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
I thank the Lord,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
To strict party-platform ties,
I should have left this town this morning,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Love don't have any place,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
One by one they followed the sun,
Make you spin or do you in,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
And they––they look at me and frown,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Never weak, but always strong,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
I got my mind made up,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
May be an actor in a plot,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Ever since I been a child,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
May you stay forever young,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
The Second World War came to an end,
How he died nobody can say,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
If you'd see me this way,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Tell me,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Automobile coming into style,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
All you can do is do what you must,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
They say that every man must fall,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
My hands didn't touch him none,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
But, it ain't me, babe,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
To be––direction home,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
All that and more and then some,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
The kingdoms of experience,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
People going down to the ground,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
God don't call it wrong,
Don't let her hear,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
It hurts me, too,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
By users, cheaters,
But I've been hanging on,
I got the worried blues,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Too serious to fool,
You and me, we had completeness,
The phone's tapped anyway,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Every brain is civilized,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
God knows it's true,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
A thousand miles from home,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Got my mind made up,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
I have no one to meet,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
The sky too is folding over you,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Honey, just for you to climb,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
And the point is slick,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Front door shut, back door too,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Or have done something wrong,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
In the hills of mystery,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
For all intended purposes,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Give you my money, honey,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Like some mystery,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I would not feel so all alone,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
But you try with your whole soul,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Just like I did before,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
My existence led by confusion boats,
And I––I walk out on my own,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Carry the New York Times,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Dream about you, baby,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Eh, singing just for you,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Stripping away at it all,
Mixing up the medicine,
You have given me eyes to see,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Father of night, father of day,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
God knows it's fragile,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
My woman needs it every day,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
A man with a badge skips by,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Love that's pure no accident,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
And I––I don't mind the pain,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Don't wanna be a bum,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Who will promise never to part,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
The country music station plays soft,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Ain't no going back,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
For the wise men and the fools,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
To be one your own,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Badge out, laid off,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
God sees it all unfold,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
This situation can only get rougher,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Resent him to the bone,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
I want my arms around you,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Look out, kid,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
And, although that we're single and free,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
I can see the turning of the key,
I'm leaving today,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
It always means so much,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
My limbs are shaking,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
My love, she speaks softly,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Don't ever try to change me,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
God knows there's a chance,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
We never much thought we could get very old,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Don't let her see,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Says he's got a bad bill,
She would have married me,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Oh, Angelina,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
In the image of someone you used to know,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I want you,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
To be so useless and all,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
But it ain't me, babe,
That four ears cannot hear him,
You're beautiful beyond words,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Who could they get to carry you,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
I'll be on my way,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Oh, watered-down love,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Loneliness, tenderness,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
You have given all there is to give,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
You have given me life to live,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
God knows when,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Beyond here lies nothing,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Got me a secret membership card,
The train leaves at half past ten,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Well, I been gambling so long,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Want you,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Drifting too far from shore,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
This world is ruled by violence,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Equality, liberty,
If she ain't feeling well,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
It always has hit me from below,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
That can do what's a-never been done,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
They must bust in early May,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Mercury, gravity,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
First to come in was the flying moth,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Living in the land of Nod,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Without your sweet love,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I went down where the vultures feed,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
In the great unknown,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
People carry roses,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Father of black, father of white,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
And, if I can save you any time,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
It's alright,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
On the stone that remains,
But I know that he don't talk,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
That can do what's never been done,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I don't want to meet your kin,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
I just don't see why I should even care,
And it's like I ain't here,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
By rivers of blindness,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Hmm, see what you can do,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Well, I don't mind dying,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Read books, repeat quotations,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I can make it through,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Like you never did before,
Speaking to some French girl,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Oh, singing just for you,
Come all without, come all within,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Over the hills and far away,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Each one playing a horn,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Face full of black soot,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Name of Martin Luther King,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
I like the way that you move your hips,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
But, if I can save you any time,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Laying low,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
From their fates try to resign,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
When all will be well,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
You were snow, you were rain,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
I got a wife and five little children,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
And ye shall be a-changed,
They say every distance is not near,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
But he can't be blamed,
To your tambourine in time,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
A man named Martin Luther King,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
He been around the world and back again,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Far away in the stormy night,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
How does it feel,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
You don't want a love that's pure,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Into my own parade,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
It's rising up above my head,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Just then the order came to charge,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
If you can't quit your sinning,
I rambled out of New York town,
Try to be a success,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Don't let her see that you need her,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
God knows how to make it flow,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Better jump down the manhole,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Don't let me drift too far,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Of ancient history,
Why she did go,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
You to me were true,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Going,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
For the politician's gain,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Look away, you rolling river,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Stone you and say good luck,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
My hands can't feel to grip,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
They say every man needs protection,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
He is centuries old,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Beating for the dead that rise,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
In one the surface was frozen,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Gonna serve somebody,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Heart of mine,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
And give him back the time he's done,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
I try my best to be just like I am,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Don't let yourself fall,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
You better chew gum,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
They tell me every man must fall,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Went back home to the yard,
And here I sit so patiently,
She never does me wrong,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
God knows there's a heaven,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
I think we better talk this over,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Well, there ain't no going back,
People talk over situations,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Don't try No Doz,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
To keep up his hate,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Father of loneliness and pain,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Tears on the letter that I write,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
It all seemed so well-timed,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
We've killed each one,
It's too bad he had to go,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
I'm pledging my time to you,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
For something that he never done,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
And rivers that ran through every day,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
And I don't want to drag you down,
You made it there somehow,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I just can't do what I've done before,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Yes, I'm so glad,
At ships with tattooed sails,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
I run right home and I went to bed,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
It's not aimed at anyone,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
But ye shall be a-changed,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
She's the worst you could ever have,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
You could look at it and weep,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Like a complete unknown,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Precious angel under the sun,
May be living in another country under another name,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Don't let yourself stumble,
That her father was going to hang,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
She'll surely turn to white,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
In his anger and his shame,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
It was you who came right through,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Vanished from my hand,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
If I didn't have to guess,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
To be on your own,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Keep me where you are,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
They don't believe in mercy,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Give what I got until I got no more,
And I'm just like that bird,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Baby, please stop crying,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
The human mind can only stand so much,
But the time ain't tall,
You stole her love from me one day,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Trust yourself,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Something about you that I can't shake,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
With no direction home,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Just don't know what to do,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
In the darkness of my night,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And may you stay forever young,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
As the daylight hours do increase,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
They lowered him down as a king,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
I try my best to be like I am,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
You got something I want plenty of,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Go away from my window,
Wintertime in New York town,
One by one they follow the sun,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Come on, come on, stick together,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Grandpa died last week,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Well, come all without, come all within,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
It's a price I have to pay,
I'd be sad and blue,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
You'll change your last name, too,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
I went into the city, into the town,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
I'd already gone the distance,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Using every angle under the sun,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
And I'm so glad,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
It's like I ain't here,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Memory, ecstasy,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Well, well, well,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
And she'll be coming forth,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
And comes to a permanent stop,
With his fist in a clinch,
Without ideals or violence,
Already the fiesta has begun,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
She said she would never forget,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Better jump down a manhole,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Corrina, Corrina,
Relationships of ownership,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
If not for you,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I bless the day I found you,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
For his age he is wise,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
And furnish me with tape,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
They walk among the stately trees,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
I wish I a-was a magician,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
He's not selling any alibis,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
And played the fife lowly,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
I never can go because, you know,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
You need something to open your eyes,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
With the juice running down my leg,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
And to come each time you call,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
To gather flowers constantly,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Thank You, Lord,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
When she lays upon the grass,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
But I will be back, I will survive,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
You're beautiful to me,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Yet every distance is not near,
To find out if she's talked,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
My dear, sweet friend,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Searching everywhere I know,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
In love and with kindness,
That foreign sound in your ear,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
When I was in Missouri,
As his youth now unfolds,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
The angels play on their horns all day,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Father of air and father of trees,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
The one we can see and can feel,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Three angels up above the street,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
It was a girl I learned it from,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
And it ain't me, babe,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Where I will always be renewed,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
There she come, now, down my way,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Of this I can't say very much,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
But, to remain as friends,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
People are crazy, times are strange,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Just like a rolling stone,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Waiting for the trains,
And you take just like a woman,
To know how much I really care,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
And come every time you call,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Going home,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
She said she would always stay,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
He won't do nothing to you,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
You say my kisses are not like his,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Precious father, loving mother,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Is looking for a new fool,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I just don't know what to do,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
He got that soft, silky skin,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Who among them would try to impress you,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
My arms and legs were broken,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
A hand set the spark,
Icicles hanging down,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
I'm never, never far from home,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Whether you are right or wrong,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Well, I may just swear,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Silhouetted by the sea,
If ever I prove false to you,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
How he died nobody could say,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
And the table's full and overflowed,
And gathering storms may arise,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Far away and over the wall,
There's always someone who understands,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
I'm going out of my mind,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
In the end,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
So glad,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
By losers, cheaters,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Without a dream in my heart,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
More people kept a-piling on,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
On this new morning, new morning,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
God knows it's terrifying,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
It don't matter what you did,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Simplify you, classify you,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Forever young, forever young,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
The country doctor rambles,
Oh, see what you can do,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Watered-down love,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Someone to open each and every door,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Don't let me change my heart,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Adiós, mi corazón,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Aim well, my little one,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Under the microscope,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Like a rolling stone,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Don't matter what you did,
A handle hid out in the dark,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
My senses have been stripped,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Don't let her know,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
So many roads, so much at stake,
See you fly or watch you die,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
You will be alright, girl,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
You've got to serve somebody,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
She's opened up a happy home,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
They––they show me to the door,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Four by four, no illusion for,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Watch the river flow,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Winter would have no spring,
You want watered-down love,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Watching the river flow,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Don't put yourself over the line,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I got no place left to turn,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
With a killer's pride, security,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
You always responded when I needed your help,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
You were striped, you were plain,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
No direction home,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
I once held her in my arms,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Eh, see what you can do,
True love of mine,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Up and down the block,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
She once was a true love of mine,
To have––be on your own,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Over your senses you have no control,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Trouble,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
They say every man need protection,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Each time we meet, love,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
We take great delight in our own company,
But, deep inside my heart,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Go melt back in the night,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
I need a shot of love,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
When I seen him lose control,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Where the neon madmen climb,
She leave by the other and roam,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And I'm in the shade,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
God knows you've got to weep,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Can't find what I need,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Tell me that you love me only,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Two by two they step in the dark,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I fell down to my bended knees,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Every head is so dignified,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
If anything is gonna sell,
All I really wanna do,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
And it's only that I'm asking,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
So I got those worries blues,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
If you throw it all away,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
I found my world, found my world in you,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
I been good while I been waiting,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
It could even be like a myth,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
In the lonely night,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I get my sweet reward,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
I got two white horses following me,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
A complete unknown,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
You gotta look some other place,
Get jailed, jump bail,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
I'm going down the river,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Made of silver or of golden,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Light yourself a candle,
Broken idols, broken heads,
But, if I will save you the time,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
When you think that you've lost everything,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Want you so bad,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Heart of mine, be still,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
And there's two white horses following me,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Not the end, not the end,
People talk of situations,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
You had enough of hatred,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
The joint is jumping,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Seven days,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I'd only have to stay,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
A million faces at my feet,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
King of the streets, child of clay,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
And you make love just like a woman,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Going, going,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Puffing on a big cigar,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I've been around this whole country,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Don't tie no bows,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
And also by his feet,
Just remember that death is not the end,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
You wanna drown love,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Spent my money on you, honey,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Only one thing I did wrong,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
And I'm back in the rain,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
You came down on me like white thunder,
But it would not be new,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
As the present now will later be past,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Oh, in somebody's room,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
We'll go someplace unknown,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
If your time to you is worth saving,
They say every man must fall,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
They run a brick and tile company,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Looking for a new fool,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
And you know I could never be your own,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Is used, it is plain,
Heart of mine, go back home,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
My woman's never sitting at home,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Six months on the chain gang,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
The only son of God Almighty,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Don't you tell Henry,
Circled by the circus sands,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
The night blows cold and rainy,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Like a dog on a chain,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Private reasons, great or small,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Hold me, baby, be near,
I can change, I swear,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Loyalty, unity,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Stand up straight and tall,
You got to serve somebody,
And on the highway of regret,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Bring the wife and family,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
I got those worried blues,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
I could have left this town by noon,
That fellow who never blushes,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Get back, write Braille,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Thieving in the alley,
May be the head of some big TV network,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
Searching high, searching low,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
The winter would hold no spring,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
To a solid rock,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I won't have my nature way,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Poor boy dressed in black,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
And point away from the past,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
True love, they've been without it,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
I know I can't win,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
And forget my pride,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
That you'd have liked me to,
God knows everything,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I want you so bad,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
She'll be coming forth,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
And think they're fooling you,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Now, won't you tell me true,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
It was from her ship sailing,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Father of minutes, father of days,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Carved next to his name,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Don't wear sandals,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
You find God in the church of your choice,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Silvio, I gotta go,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
To shine in through,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
"Not me," said his manager,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Looking 'bout the government,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
That fired the gun,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
But something has changed,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
When there is no more,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Hang around the ink-well,
Had no one to go my bail,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Paradise, sacrifice,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Never did feel this way before,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
The man in the trench-coat,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
To stay closer than any friend,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
A dream about you, baby,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Try hard, get barred,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
The carpet too is moving under you,
To be without a home,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Ten thousand men on the move,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Far past the frozen leaves,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
A true love of mine,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
But you're doing it again,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
You can run down to the desert,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
And, if anybody asks me,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I went into the city, went into the town,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Holding his club like he was a king,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Three by three they're turning the key,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
But you were gambling for support,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Friends with you,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
I love you, pretty baby,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Look who's back in town,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Get born, keep warm,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Joey, Joey,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Since you've been gone,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
The day you quit me, baby,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
But, if you want me to,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
I tried to reach you, honey,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Nothing was delivered,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
And she aches just like a woman,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
So unknown,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
And to come every time you call,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
And, though the line is cut,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
I threw it all away,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
"Come along and take a trip,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Well, I'm so glad,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
But evidently she don't,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
You even make love just like a woman,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Says he's got a bad cough,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
The light I never knowed,
If'n you don't know by now,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
You don't have to feed me,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
All the silver, all the gold,
If you must cling to someone,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
You need something to open up a new door,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But he's the property of Jesus,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
God knows there's a purpose,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Like as not, it's better so,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
And I got the worried blues,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
We'll fly the night away,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Broken switches, broken gates,
To be alone with you,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Without a love of my own,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
And I got those worried blues,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
To be out on your own,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
That must be what it's all about,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Someone to close his heart,
Newspapermen eating candy,
The beat is pumping,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
That five walls cannot hide him,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
God knows there's a river,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
And the whole world is on your case,
The sky too is folding under you,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
I landed up on the downtown side,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Rabbit running down across the road,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I'm so glad,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Is it really any wonder,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Every nerve is analyzed,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
She got great big hind legs,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
But the bottles are done,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
When the night comes falling,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
I just say no thanks,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Don't steal, don't lift,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
You can raise up your right hand,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Where life and death are memorized,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
No, nothing was delivered,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
He's young and on fire,
Stay away from the train line,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Ye shall be changed,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
In the turning of twilight,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Said I'm pressing on,
But it ain't him to blame,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
But I'm saved,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Don't know what to do without it,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Father of day, father of night,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
God don't call it treason,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
You follow, find yourself at war,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
A worried man with a worried mind,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Strangers all give me the news,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Staying far behind without you,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
And your streets are getting empty,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Yesterday's just a memory,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Eh, in somebody's room,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Alright, I'm so glad,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
They pass by so silently,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
The night passed away so quickly,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Well, I gave you all my money,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Advertising signs, they con,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Far away from it all,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
God knows it's a struggle,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
And, if I see the day,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Or select you or dissect you,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
While riding on a train going west,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
The air is getting hotter,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I been good,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
New morning,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Madams light the candles,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
And not going through any great extreme,
Just to know that you are near,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
I can't understand,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Broken lines, broken strings,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
For she ain't the same,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
They say everything can be replaced,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
God knows it's outta sight,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
They keep it all hid,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
With what your fate is going to be,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Well, get sick, get well,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Strike another match, go start anew,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Baby, let me follow you down,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
You have explained every mystery,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
And all of your children start to resent you,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
The day would surely have to break,
God knows that, when you see it,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Day you quit me, baby,
To hang and to lynch,
Socialism, hypnotism,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Going, going, gone,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
You have given everything to me,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
That the laws are with him,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
So, never leave me lonely,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
For her to arrive,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Out to the windy beach,
To hide 'neath a hood,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Just as long as you stay with me,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
The night would see me wide awake,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Well, I can't understand,
Human gods aim for their mark,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
The midnight rain follows the train,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
As I travel down life's pathway,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Oxford Town around the bend,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Honey, I will meet you there,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
I wish tonight were here,
They took a clean-cut kid,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
To protect his white skin,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Go down to the river, babe,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
God knows you ain't pretty,
It's really something,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
You got something better,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I had so much left to do,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
China doll, alcohol,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
I had no one for to go my bail,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Fare thee well but for a while,
But now morning is clear,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
I shall be released,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
I swung on to my old guitar,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
The path you've endured has been rough,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
I just keep pressing on,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
They say every man must need protection,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Hmm, I can make it through,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Thinking about the government,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Take the motherless children off the street,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Serve somebody,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Too noble to neglect,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Precious memories, how they linger,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
First degree and second degree,
All them prophets good and gone,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Need a woman all the time,
We live in a political world,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
But I would not feel so all alone,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
You married young just like your ma,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Pressing on,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
High water rising, rising night and day,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
By the night and been to some place new,
Tell her not to worry,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
If today was not a crooked highway,
One by one until there were none,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Keep a clean nose,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Don't follow leaders,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
He's the property of Jesus,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Saved,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
God knows it's a crime,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
I went down to scrub and rub,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
"Not I," said the referee,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
I got a bird that whistles,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Every moon is so sanctified,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
That's where you belong --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Democracy don't rule the world --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.

Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.

So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
I been in this thing too long.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
When I run outta things to investigate.
Honey, baby.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
He could die happily ever after.
No kindred or relative nigh.
And all your raging glory.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
You are on the bottom.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Girls like birds fly away.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Crying out that he was framed.
You always got more than enough rope.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Suffering like a fool.
Rode slowly back again.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Father of love and father of rain.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Walking around with no one else.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
And keep away from pranks.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
I froze right to the bone.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.

'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
I'd give anything to be with you.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Billy, you been running for so long.
I stood wondering which way to go.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Gonna serve somebody.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.

If he don't expect to be housing flushes.

And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
And I was brought up by my brother.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Oh, her darling love she found.
It's just the old American way.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Close your eyes, close the door.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Wants to get it paid off.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
For she once was a true love of mine.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
As the present now will later be past.
Mama, you are on my mind.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
I been worrying about you, baby.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
Havanageeluh.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Baby, baby.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Without a love of my own.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
If you just let me follow you down.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
They both rode off together.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
I've seen trouble all my days.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
After losing every battle.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
Everything is broken.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
But you were tangled up in blue.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
That must be what it's all about.
You're my honey.
With your golden loom.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
So, darling, you better come through.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Come over here from over there, girl.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Is tearing up your mind.
You won't get it for money.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.

About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.

The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
My mind is breaking.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
And she had left him to die in there.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
There's no words that need to be said.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
You're too hot, darling.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.

Where I was born and partly raised.

But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
That set everybody free.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
With the golden loom.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Like you never done before.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
And the Santa Fe.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Must be and that is all.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
I'm not the one you need.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Take me as I am or let me go.
Come on, baby.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Find out something only dead men know.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
For me to return to or chase.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
And I've never been too impressed.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
When I'm alone with you.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
You're on the bottom.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
And the people that confronted him were many.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I did not do it knowingly.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
When you made everybody pay.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.

That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.

But that's what I am paid to do.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
And every window made of glass.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.

The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.

Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.

I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.

All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.

I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Duality, mortality.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
It always does when you're with me.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
That's the way I remember her best.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Yes, and I'll go last.
And your highway's getting filled.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
Leave no stone unturned.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
All because his face was brown.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
"Get well, get well," said she.
I know you always say that you agree.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
I see that stationmaster too.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
Buildings going up to the sky.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
It'll never do, somehow.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Or put up against the wall.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
With my suitcase in my hand.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
He's got his mother's eyes.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Waiting on my burying ground.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
You don't have to worry any more.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Hope you're ready.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Throw my ticket in the wind.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
And relive my dreams.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
And they gotta cut something.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Just what this song is all about.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
So the radio didn't work so well.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
I hope I'm ready.
I can't fight them anymore.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
You'll never see me frown.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
In the palace of the Pope.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Try to avoid the scandals.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
Hmm, tell me.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
It would go up against every rule.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
You to me were the best.
And that failure's no success at all.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
But these to tell what's true.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Figuring a way to get back home.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Baby, let me follow you down.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
I hope you're ready.
From my toes up to my ears.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
"Don't point your finger at me.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
And no time to think.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Nobility, humility.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Broken voices on broken phones.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
Step lightly on the ground.
The same as my father before him.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
The whole night through.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Lay dead beside him there.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
To which a scoundrel clings.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
We may not make it through the night.
Mary wore three links of chain.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
But there's one promise, darling:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Man is opposed to fair play:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
His epitaph plain:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Serve somebody:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Till I come into New York town:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Yeah, serve somebody:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Make promises by the hour;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Had to be held down by big police;
Crumble into one another;
So many things that we never will undo;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Some speak of the future;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
I find complete love;
All lies and jest;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;

<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>

<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?"

<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
What's wrong with you this time?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How can I live for You?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
The love that a stranger might receive?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Am I still dreaming yet?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
What would life be?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Have they missed you?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Are you ready?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
What good am I?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
By golly, what more can I say?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Baby, can I come home with you?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Why must you always try to make me over?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
How could they ever mistake you?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Where did you hide your halo?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Across the swooping plain?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
How's everything in heaven?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Can you get back in?
Before you call him a man?
Of everything you see?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
What do you think about that, my friend?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Before he can see the sky?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Why and what's the reason for?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
How many more can they afford?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
That too many people have died?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
How many more without any reward?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Must everybody bow?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
What can I do for You?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Why would I want to take your life?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How come you don't send me no regards?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Just like a rolling stone?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
When he's standing in front of you?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Am I ready?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
How does it feel?
Before it's washed to the sea?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
When did you leave heaven?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Poor boy, where you been?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Too many people have died?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
What else can a poor boy do?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Before he can hear people cry?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
How could they let you go?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Does anyone even try?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
For all these earthly things?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
And how does it feel?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Like a rolling stone?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
How long are we gonna be riding?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Before they're forever banned?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
What can I give to You?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
And one deserving of affection?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Baby, what more can I tell?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
How many compared to yesterday?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Where did you lose your wings?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Baby, can't you tell?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Gal, where you been so long?
Did you respect me for what I did?
To love and follow His direction?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Across the swamp of time?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Does he change the course of rivers?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Can I come home with you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Has anybody seen my love?
How much poison did they inhale?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
But who did I see but the one I love?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
Well, the dog collar's from India
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
It was put together down in Argentina
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Somebody seen him hanging around
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
But now something has changed
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
Its iron claws attached
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
While some, on principles baptized
I will not go down under the ground
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
I live in another world
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Everything stays down where it's wounded
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
And those whom doom and death had spared
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Now, a very great man once said
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Now, whenever I get up and
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
I've been walking around
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
We live in a political world
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Maybe someday you will understand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
There ain't nothing in this world
I run right home and I went to bed
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
To see him obviously framed
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Now you don't act so––so proud
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And your trouble is you know it too good
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Roving gambler, he was very bored
They took a clean-cut kid
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
You try so hard, but you don't understand
I want you, baby, just to understand
"Equality". I spoke the word
Many times I've often prayed
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
By no special friend
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
And things would be different the next time we wed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
All the sweethearts you can hold
You used––be so proud
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
As I stand upon the sand
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
How many times can a man turn his head
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
He was a clean-cut kid
I'll always thank the Lord
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
You used to be so amused
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Things would be different the next time we wed
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
She let go of my hand
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
I thought that it was well-understood
For what you sold that's not been received
But she ain't gonna find the road
I still can remember the way that you smiled
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Then came the warning that was before the flood
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Just what you had in mind
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Nothing was delivered
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Now you don't seem so proud
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
So I'll make my stand
Silvio, silver and gold
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
And into the path you are hurled
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
And then you told me later as I apologized
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
But something has changed
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
It's something you did
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
And I ain't complaining none
Though its shadow's metal badge
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
When I'm all alone
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Feel to moan, but unlike before
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Just pick anyone
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
And you see why it's so unique to be
Should I put them by your gate
A girl who would murder her own, true love
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
I been wondering all about me
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
I do declare
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
From all the plans they do pursue
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Con you into thinking that you're the one
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
And I would send a message
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Taking care of somebody nice
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
They say don't come back no more
I can survive and I can endure
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
And suddenly there appeared before me
With all memory and fate
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
And I'm just the same as anyone else
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
You know, it's not even safe no more
What you're gonna say when you get home
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Remember me to the one who lives there
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
She knows there's no success like failure
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Should I leave them by your gate
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
See the primitive wallflower freeze
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Up into some paradise
We see this empty cage now corrode
Well, it's all new to me
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
And never sat once at the head of the table
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Just what you will say when you get home
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
The man the authorities came to blame
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
He'll see by his grave
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
But the dark does die
When the rain is blowing in your face
If dogs run free, why not we
How many ears must one man have
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
You smiling through the fence at me
She plunged him into well water where
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Waiting to find out what price
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
"It's only you that he does crave
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Well, six white horses that you did promise
So up she picked her babies three
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
You could almost think that you're seeing double
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Full of hope and desire
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
She been gone
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Among the lovely people living free
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
I am homeless, come and take me
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
At dawn my lover comes to me
All I feel is heat and flame
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
To show you something you seen before
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
I'm ready for to fade
The cause was there before we came
While them that defend what they cannot see
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
I'm sure you're the one to blame
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
What about that millionaire
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Limited in sex they dare
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
It's all new to me
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
But I can get another one
As he rises to fame
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
What good am I then to others and me
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the Negro's name
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
But I can't say I sympathize
Remember me to one who lives there
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
It's getting dark, too dark to see
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
If dogs run free, why not me
If dogs run free, then what must be
There were times when I was so lonesome
But I feel nothing for their game
It'll be with me unto the grave
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Hunger pays a heavy price
You cut to the core
I don't even notice she gone
I rode with him in a taxi once
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Better stay away from those
"That I might be gone a long, old time
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Says it's closing time
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
On the rising curve
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Lies that life is black-and-white
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Mona tried to tell me
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
So, I called up the operator of time
A bed that is never mine
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
So I remember every face
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
You say you're looking for someone
Leaving men wholly, totally free
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
From the Golden Gate Bridge
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
You're not free to belong to me
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
That she's the same one
Where I could watch her waltz for free
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
From the start by the rule
When the roses fade
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
What's probably got you baffled more
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
How was I to know you'd be the one
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
You into thinking you're the one
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
So I look like a walking mountain range
But it won't be over till they clear his name
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
The crashing waves roll over me
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Little did I realize
You just pick anyone
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
To give the special one you seek a chance
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
And plenty time for good romance
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Knows there's no success like failure
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
You said you'd never compromise
Trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Oh, trust yourself
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
The battle outside raging
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Well, I set my monkey on the log
If I was with her too long
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
For your weary toes to be touching
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Where the time and the tempo drag
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
She rode by night and came by morning
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
What am I saying? What am I knowing
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Deceived me into thinking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
And the cards are no good that you're holding
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
The order is rapidly fading
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
But then a whistle will be blowing
The order is a-rapidly fading
There's nothing in here moving
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
'Cause the battle outside raging
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Beyond here lies nothing
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
They're drinking up and walking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
It's not a bad way to make a living
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And there's no telling who that it's naming
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
And how I know I'll make it through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Look out, the saints are coming through
I have fallen far beneath
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Then she told us how times were tough
You go north and you go south
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Shoot in the back
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
But they caught him and they brought him back
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Well, there ain't no going back
Her voice once and talk
Make everything from toy guns that spark
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
You turn around to take a final peek
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
I wish she'd unlock
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
The man in me will do nearly any task
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
A-how does it feel
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
A girl by the whirlpool
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
How does it feel
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Then why don't she tell
They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
I chased me a woman up the hill
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
All and all can only fall
Ring bar, hard to tell
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Soul to soul our shadows roll
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Muttering small talk at the wall
Oh, how does it feel
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
How many seas must a white dove sail
He's sure got a lot of gall
He's taught in his school
As the last fire-truck from hell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
How many seas must the white dove sail
Ring bell, hard to tell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
You better not chew gum
Now, they asked me to read a poem
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
"For you cannot relive them
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Two eyes took the aim
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
But I can hear another drum
And remain as I am
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Well, you fake just like a woman
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
To remember the times when I was your only man
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Somebody new to beat on
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Darkness at the break of noon
She said that all the railroad men
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Well, I'm hanging on
Why did you trade heaven
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
I'll be waiting at the station
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But I swear I see my reflection
He got that fortress on the mountain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Suicide remarks are torn
Trying to get a lead on
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Must meet the dawn
To my knowledge there's just one man
But the second mother was with the seventh son
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Nothing we can call our own
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Their religion of the little ten women
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
In the pigpen
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
That long, black train is pulling down
But it's hard to think on
That long, black train is pulling on down
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
She got such a sweet disposition
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
As you sit on the box you keep him in
And all their daughters put me down
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
You don't need a weatherman
Uncle Rat went running downtown
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
"Not me," said the gambling man
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
But all their daughters put me down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Yes, and someone must explain
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
And she aches just like a woman
A-she takes just like a woman
Have died in battle or in vain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
In ceremonies of the horsemen
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And she wakes just like a woman
Out of the shower comes a football man
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
But the post office has been stolen
All their daughters put me down
You need something to make it known
And the corner sign
As they rode him in custody down to the station
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Advertising signs that con
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
The next morning she had awoken
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
I figure maybe we're even
You take just like a woman
Poor boy in a red-hot town
For the loser now will be later to win
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
She takes just like a woman
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
I don't even care if I ever see her again
And you ache a-just like a woman
But me, I expected it to happen
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
The ones that jump on the wagon
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Guns and clubs followed him down
But the second mom was with the seventh son
How many roads must a man walk down
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
From heights that they could not gain
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
My love, she's like some raven
For the loser now might be later to win
And there's no exit in any direction
How can the life of such a man
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Silvio, I gotta go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
All I'd like you to do
Every place I wanna go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
There is a place you go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
All I really wanna do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
There's nothing you can say or do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Aladdin and his lamp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
The man in the coon-skin cap
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
I walked down there and ended up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
How many times must a man look up
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Man in the coon-skin cap
What good am I while you softly weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
The face of God will appear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
For I am married to a house carpenter
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
But morning is clear
Still I say her love-words over
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
My ship is in the harbor
When you whispered in my ear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
The lover who has just walked out your door
The wind howls like a hammer
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
At any moment you could go under
And I don't even think about her
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I don't have to go far
Who came here from Cuba's door
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Never no more do I wonder
So, don't fear if you hear
She took him by his long, yellow hair
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Still I've always kind of missed her
You heard me saying a prayer for
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Alone you stand with nobody near
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
All you boys better run for cover
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
When only you are near
I say, "Why you say that for
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
In one I was running and in another
I could feel a whole lot better
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
I close my eyes and I wonder
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
For all eternity I think I will remember
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
With a fantastic collection of stamps
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
At times I think there are no words
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Six-time losers
Well, the ragman draws circles
When your mother sends back all your invitations
People on the platforms
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Six-time users
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Wants eleven dollar bills
The cowboy angel rides
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Now, you must provide some answers
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
I let it slip gladly to my friends
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
People carry roses
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
As friends and other strangers
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Glide across the lonely years
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
But, though the masters make the rules
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
To the cutting of fences
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
You can fall down on your knees
You should be made to wear earphones
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
I'd gladly confess
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
To memorizing politics
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Don't wear sandals
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
I try to tell it like it is
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
You know that he has no intentions
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Romantic facts of musketeers
True love can make a blade of grass
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
With a big bouquet of the roses
That it's you and no one else that owns
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
I'm gonna let you pass
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
They whisper in the wings
We living in times when men commit crimes
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Seven days
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And so Patty calls the cops
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
And the poor white remains
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
The empty-handed painter from your streets
But still remains
Mama, you know, awaits the news
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
And inside it with the people made of molasses
He's not selling any alibis
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
And tells me of her dreams
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
What good am I if I say foolish things
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Good and bad, I define these terms
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
You been hurt so many times
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And then complains
Thinking of a series of dreams
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Girl by the whirlpool's
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
You never turned around to see the frowns
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
And I try to harmonize with songs
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
"Not me," said the man whose fists
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
To sharpen the senses
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And your father, to your sister he explains
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Statues made of matchsticks
And, though the masters make the rules
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Her window's wide open, African trees
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Don't follow leaders
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And the princess and the prince discuss
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
They tell me to be discreet
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
The slow one now will later be fast
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Wait for the morning light
Keep it in your mind and not forget
They tell me revenge is sweet
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Well, early in the morning till late at night
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Someday, everything is gonna be different
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I'm moving after midnight
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Ain't it hard when you discover that
It don't take too long to find out
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
You are there in the flickering light
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
And, since my feet are now fast
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
I got into the driver's seat
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
I soon get some rest
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
He built a fire on Main Street
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
And I, in my armor, turning about
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
With your pockets well protected at last
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Everything is always right
Yet you know there is no answer fit
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
And the first one now will later be last
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
To hold each other tight
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
I think that it's best
Plants in the bed, but
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
We can hold up a toast if we meet
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
You used to laugh–make fun about
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
By the way, that's a cute hat
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
How many years can some people exist
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
He really wasn't where it's at
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Like a corkscrew to my heart
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
In the precious winds they rot
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
One more night the moon is shining bright
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
You're gonna get hit
Talking that the heat put
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
One more night I will wait for the light
But, then again, there's only one I've met
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
In the stillness of the midnight
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
How many years can a mountain exist
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
That might be all that you got
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
She seems too far out
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Keep me set apart
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Without any doubt
So he never thinks straight
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
I'm on the pavement
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
There's some people that
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Everyone still talks about
The slowest now will later be fast
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Johnny's in the basement
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
You're hearing my heart beat
But, if the arrow is straight
You used to laugh about
You don't forget
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
To protect you and defend you
To be alone with you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
I'll remember you
I can be just like you
It's just crazy being here with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
He been living there three years now
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Don't it always go to show
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Ring them bells for the chosen few
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
It only goes to show
With only you in view
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Down every street there's a window
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
The only one I know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
But sooner or later one of us must know
Don't it always a-go to show
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
I'd sure like to know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Well, I'd sure like to know
Sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Yes, I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
The same thing I would want today
She puts it to me plain as day
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
We banged the drum slowly
No, you'll not now or no other day
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And for His love they took His life away
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
My mind weaves a symphony
And the ladies treat me kindly
And the only tune my guitar could play
Spouted out that liberty
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
A cock is crowing far away
From phony jealousy
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
If I don't take the chance to try
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
For them that think death's honesty
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
But I wish there was something you would do or say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
I did not do it harmfully
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
How many times must the cannon balls fly
And it's up to you to say
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
But I can't deny
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
I send you all my money
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Is worth more than I could pay
Maggie says that many say
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
My ears hear a symphony
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Well, I saw it advertised one day
The Spanish-American War had its day
That I was just a puppet in a play
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
She smiles, walks the other way
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
So they took him to the infirmary
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
For them that must obey authority
To those condemned to act accordingly
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
And that which you've given me today
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Don't you tell Henry
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Or if you just want some company
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
So, I'm walking down your highway
Though I'd never say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
She knocked upon it anyway
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
But you can never steal away
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
For them that think death––death's honesty
So I run down most hurriedly
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Well, I'm walking down the highway
That I done it the way
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Went to the doctor the very next day
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Private reasons – great or small –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Oh, my–
To know where you are –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Indians camp along her border –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
It can't be this way everywhere –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
I long to hold you in the night –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Ten thousand miles or more –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Remember me to one who lives there –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Disconnect these cables––
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
You will not hear a laugh –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Ha–va–
I hope that you can hear––
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Haven't seen her since that night –
I a-hope you can hear––
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Whispering your secret emotion –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Havanagee–luh–
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Hang out the whole next day –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Havana–gee–
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Hava–na–
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
How badly they were shocked –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
You do what you must do and you do it well –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
First degree and second degree –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Leave all the children home –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
I got no idea what I want –
I'm sure it was not three –
As suicide remarks are torn –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
