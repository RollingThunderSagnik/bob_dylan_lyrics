She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!

Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!

Goodnight!
You must think I'm crazy!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!

But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Yeah, man!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
How they ever flood my soul!
Well!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Alright, now!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!

Hootenanny television!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!

He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
I'm in love with you!

We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, no!
I wanna be yours!
Start over!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
My God, they killed Him!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
He punched me out!
Oh!
I've got the freight train blues!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
I figured they was in my TV set!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Dignity never been photographed!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Get on your horse and ride away."
I'll see her soon, I know."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
I can't find my knees."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
But I know what you want."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
We'll both go home together."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Tangled up in blue."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Has kindly assisted me home."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
We'll both go off together."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
But we were tangled up in blue."
You must know about my debutante."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
I didn't see you around."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
I love far better than thee."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
God said, "On Highway 61."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
You and I'll never know."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
I'll apply them all to thee."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
They look as white as snow."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
You can't blame us at all."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Where you and I will unite."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
It's all for the love of thee."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
And it's all for the love of thee."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Have it on Highway 61."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
That you must always first forgive them."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
I'll endow them onto thee."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"Is it easy to forget?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Come flowing down so free?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
I'll bring back my lady."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Would kill a little bird like me."
He said, "Tell me about it."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
You can't blame me at all."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
"That way down Highway 61."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
They look as dark as night."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
And have it on Highway 61."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Country'll grow."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
And keep him good company."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
And punched my cigarette."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
And pretend that you never have met."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
We want folksingers here."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
So write to her tenderly."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
And hung on a willow tree."
I would want again tomorrow."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Will mourn for your return."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Is looking for a new fool,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
How he died nobody can say,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
But it would not be new,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
My hands can't feel to grip,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Well, get sick, get well,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Speaking to some French girl,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
But I'm pressing on,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
I tried to reach you, honey,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Love that's pure no accident,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
How he died nobody could say,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Got me a secret membership card,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
And joined the John Birch Society,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
They lowered him down as a king,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Forever young, forever young,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
He been around the world and back again,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
If'n you don't know by now,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
She leave by the other and roam,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
The only son of God Almighty,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
China doll, alcohol,
That two healers cannot heal him,
We take great delight in our own company,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I never can go because, you know,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
The night would see me wide awake,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
For her to arrive,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Using every angle under the sun,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Far away from it all,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
It could even be like a myth,
He's young and on fire,
But you're doing it again,
Baby, please stop crying,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Try to be a success,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Dust on my face and my cape,
The sky too is folding over you,
Three by three they're turning the key,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Precious father, loving mother,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Don't let me drift too far,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
You got something better,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Like a rolling stone,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Just like I did before,
And, if I can save you any time,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
The night passed away so quickly,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Winter would have no spring,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
All you can do is do what you must,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
I got my mind made up,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
And point away from the past,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
And I––I walk out on my own,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Who will promise never to part,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
To know how much I really care,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
But it ain't him to blame,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
The day would surely have to break,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
By rivers of blindness,
God knows it's terrifying,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
And I'm so glad,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Never weak, but always strong,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
It always means so much,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Well, I gave you all my money,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
If she ain't feeling well,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
I like the way that you move your hips,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Without your sweet love,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
It always has hit me from below,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
It's too bad he had to go,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
One by one they followed the sun,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Keep a clean nose,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
I have no one to meet,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
God don't call it treason,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
As the daylight hours do increase,
You to me were true,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Look out, kid,
I should have left this town this morning,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Well, I been gambling so long,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Want you,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
She once was a true love of mine,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
I'm so glad,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
At the close of the day,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Father of black, father of white,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
The Second World War came to an end,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Trust yourself,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
In the hills of mystery,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
That they do not respect in any degree,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Precious angel under the sun,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Hold me, baby, be near,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
That can do what's never been done,
Love don't have any place,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
But you were gambling for support,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Eh, singing just for you,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Loneliness, tenderness,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Just remember that death is not the end,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Corrina, Corrina,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Of this I can't say very much,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
For something that he never done,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Don't follow leaders,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
That one doctor cannot save him,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Don't know what to do without it,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
God knows it's fragile,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
They say everything can be replaced,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
My limbs are shaking,
Giving back all of what you owe,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
And think they're fooling you,
Well, I may just swear,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Father of day, father of night,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Oxford Town around the bend,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Somewhere down the road some day,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
It's like I ain't here,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
My senses have been stripped,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Don't let her know that you love her,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
"Not me," said his manager,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
I'll go see them come down my way,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
But you try with your whole soul,
The carpet too is moving under you,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
And every cause that ever I fought,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
"Come along and take a trip,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Father who build the mountain so high,
You'll change your last name, too,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Already the fiesta has begun,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
I got a wife and five little children,
While paupers change possessions,
Judge and jury took their stand,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
God knows it's a crime,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Give you my money, honey,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I been good,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
But the bottles are done,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
People carry roses,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
And may you stay forever young,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
You can hear them tires squeal,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
As I travel down life's pathway,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
First to come in was the flying moth,
If not for you,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
In the turning of twilight,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
He won't do nothing to you,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
For she ain't the same,
See her in that very tight skirt,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
You got something I want plenty of,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
That long, black train is pulling down,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
She got great big hind legs,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
They say that every man must fall,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
You have given me eyes to see,
People going down to the ground,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Keep me where you are,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Stand up straight and tall,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
She said she would always stay,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
And, although that we're single and free,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
My woman needs it every day,
That must be what it's all about,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Heart of mine, be still,
When God and man will be reconciled,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
And come every time you call,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
You will be alright, girl,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Watching the river flow,
But he can't be blamed,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
And, if I see the day,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Out to the windy beach,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
And also by his feet,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Looking 'bout the government,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Gonna serve somebody,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And I got those worried blues,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
That you'd have liked me to,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
And gathering storms may arise,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Don't let yourself fall,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Up and down the block,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
How does it feel,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Ever since I been a child,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Made of silver or of golden,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
No direction home,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
A hand set the spark,
Waiting for the trains,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Don't let yourself stumble,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
We'll fly the night away,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Try hard, get barred,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
I would not feel so all alone,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
By losers, cheaters,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
We live in a political world,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Get dressed, get blessed,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
In love and with kindness,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Don't mind the driving rain,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Better jump down a manhole,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Of ancient history,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Resent him to the bone,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
You better chew gum,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
And I got the worried blues,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Father of night, father of day,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
She said she would never forget,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I'd only have to stay,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
I been riding the midnight train,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
To be alone with you,
You even make love just like a woman,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Better jump down the manhole,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Makes no difference where she's been,
It's really something,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
I need a shot of love,
Front door shut, back door too,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Wasn't making any great connection,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
She'll be coming forth,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
And there's two white horses following me,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Broken hands on broken plows,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
I landed up on the downtown side,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
I got those worried blues,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Stripping away at it all,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Baby, let me follow you down,
In the foggy web of destiny,
And, if anybody asks me,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
He's the property of Jesus,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Too serious to fool,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
In the great unknown,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Never needed to call you my whore,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Over your senses you have no control,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Watered-down love,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
First degree and second degree,
It don't matter what you did,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Well, I can't understand,
The light I never knowed,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Day you quit me, baby,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
And to come every time you call,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
I'm leaving today,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
They must bust in early May,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
There she come, now, down my way,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Why she did go,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Don't steal, don't lift,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
There's always someone who understands,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
They––they show me to the door,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
I want you,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
I bless the day I found you,
Now, won't you tell me true,
I went out last night to take a little round,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
More people kept a-piling on,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
I can see the turning of the key,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
To hang and to lynch,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
I've been all around the world, boys,
She's crying like an evil stone,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Friends with you,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Don't matter what you did,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
It still ain't me, babe,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Every head is so dignified,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Searching high, searching low,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
For his age he is wise,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Don't let her know,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
That fired the gun,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
To be one your own,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Yesterday's just a memory,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
God knows you've got to weep,
And not going through any great extreme,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Never did feel this way before,
I just keep pressing on,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
But it ain't me, babe,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
So, never leave me lonely,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Like a dog on a chain,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Madams light the candles,
I swung on to my old guitar,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
So I got those worries blues,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
You have given me life to live,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
In the little church a-this side of town,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
The wind blowing the snow around,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Don't ever try to change me,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Just like a rolling stone,
The one we can see and can feel,
Far away and over the wall,
It's not aimed at anyone,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
It was you who came right through,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
God knows there's a purpose,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
See you fly or watch you die,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
God don't call it wrong,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
She'll surely turn to white,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I can finish this alone, honey,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Without ideals or violence,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
If you'd see me this way,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
I don't wanna fake you out,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
You married young just like your ma,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Going home,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
The beat is pumping,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Aim well, my little one,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Staying far behind without you,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
True love of mine,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Saved,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
They walk among the stately trees,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
The day you quit me, baby,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
And you take just like a woman,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I can change, I swear,
It hurts me, too,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
I had so much left to do,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Silvio, I gotta go,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
If I didn't have to guess,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
We've killed each one,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Strike another match, go start anew,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Drifting too far from shore,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
I get my sweet reward,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
He's not selling any alibis,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Without a love of my own,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Don't let her see,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
To be on your own,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
A handle hid out in the dark,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Ooh, watered-down love,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Since you've been gone,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
I know I can't win,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
I'm gonna let you pass,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
In another I witnessed a crime,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
To gather flowers constantly,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Simplify you, classify you,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
When all will be well,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
God knows when,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
A man with a badge skips by,
It's alright,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
In one the surface was frozen,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
They keep it all hid,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
The wind howls like a hammer,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
I'm pledging my time to you,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I wish tonight were here,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
God knows how to make it flow,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
For all intended purposes,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Who could they get to carry you,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
To a solid rock,
And you make love just like a woman,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
You don't want a love that's pure,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Bring the wife and family,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
I once held her in my arms,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
And on the highway of regret,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
And played the fife lowly,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
The man there said he loved my sound,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
I believe I'm fixing to die,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
You can run down to the desert,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
I love you, pretty baby,
No, nothing was delivered,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Five by five they tried to survive,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
If you throw it all away,
And the point is slick,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
May be living in another country under another name,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
I try my best to be like I am,
They say every man needs protection,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
But, if I can save you any time,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Got my mind made up,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Living in the land of Nod,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Fare thee well but for a while,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
May be an actor in a plot,
I don't care if you analyze me,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
I can't be good, baby,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
He is centuries old,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Nothing too very scientific,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
In the lonely night,
All I really wanna do,
I long to see you in the morning light,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
You have given all there is to give,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
But, if you want me to,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
They say every man must fall,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Ain't no going back,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Three angels up above the street,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
And they––they look at me and frown,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Go down to the river, babe,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
I thank the Lord,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
That four ears cannot hear him,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Two by two they step in the dark,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
I had a dream about you, baby,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
This place ain't doing me any good,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Relationships of ownership,
Well, I'm pressing on,
And furnish me with tape,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Oh, Angelina,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Who among them would try to impress you,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Dream about you, baby,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
With his candle lit into the sun,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I don't want to meet your kin,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Newspapermen eating candy,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Don't put yourself over the line,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
King of the streets, child of clay,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
To be without a home,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I just can't beg you anymore,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Pick you up every time you fall,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Automobile coming into style,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Don't let her hear,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
And to come each time you call,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
I want my arms around you,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
That fellow who never blushes,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
And comes to a permanent stop,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
A thousand miles from home,
And she aches just like a woman,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Mixing up the medicine,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Over the hills and far away,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
This world is ruled by violence,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
To have––be on your own,
God knows it's a struggle,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
My arms and legs were broken,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Grandpa died last week,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I think we better talk this over,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
If anything is gonna sell,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
The country doctor rambles,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Eh, see what you can do,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
I can't understand,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
A million faces at my feet,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
They took a clean-cut kid,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
A true love of mine,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
As his youth now unfolds,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
This situation can only get rougher,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Get born, keep warm,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Like a complete unknown,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Beyond here lies nothing,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Well, well, well,
And it ain't me, babe,
You gotta look some other place,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
But something has changed,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Searching everywhere I know,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Carved next to his name,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
And I'm back in the rain,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
You need something to open your eyes,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Without a dream in my heart,
I'm going out of my mind,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
With a killer's pride, security,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
You were snow, you were rain,
You're beautiful beyond words,
And you know I could never be your own,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Oh, singing just for you,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
I just don't know what to do,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I shall be released,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Don't you tell Henry,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
My love, she speaks like silence,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Just as long as you stay with me,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
I can't cross the line, you know,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
You need something to open up a new door,
You made it there somehow,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
"Not I," said the referee,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
The winter would hold no spring,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Ye shall be changed,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Every nerve is analyzed,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I got a bird that whistles,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Hang around the ink-well,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Is it really any wonder,
Like as not, it's better so,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Father of air and father of trees,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Need a woman all the time,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Where I will always be renewed,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
One more night the stars are in sight,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
I don't care if you feel like me,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
It was from her ship sailing,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Or select you or dissect you,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
My woman's never sitting at home,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
You stole her love from me one day,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
I just say no thanks,
The human mind can only stand so much,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
For the wise men and the fools,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
The kingdoms of experience,
That can do what's a-never been done,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Icicles hanging down,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
God knows there's a heaven,
Stay away from the train line,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
One by one until there were none,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Each one playing a horn,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
The man in the trench-coat,
Precious memories, how they linger,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Just don't know what to do,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
And the whole world is on your case,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Going, going, gone,
And it's only that I'm asking,
People talk of situations,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Circled by the circus sands,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Don't tie no bows,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
But, if I will save you the time,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
As the present now will later be past,
Paradise, sacrifice,
A dream about you, baby,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
With what your fate is going to be,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
You had enough of hatred,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Well, I'm so glad,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
The air is getting hotter,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
She would have married me,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
The haunted, frightened trees,
God knows it's outta sight,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Father of loneliness and pain,
A complete unknown,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
So unknown,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Far away in the stormy night,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
I rambled out of New York town,
Get back, write Braille,
You want watered-down love,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
When there is no more,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
People talk over situations,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Just to know that you are near,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Going,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
But ye shall be a-changed,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Adiós, mi corazón,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
You're beautiful to me,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Had no one to go my bail,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
She never does me wrong,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
God knows there's a river,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
When the night comes falling,
In the end,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
All them prophets good and gone,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
My hands didn't touch him none,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Badge out, laid off,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Far past the frozen leaves,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Each time we meet, love,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
With his fist in a clinch,
But, deep inside my heart,
Come on, come on, stick together,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
And I'm in the shade,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
I won't have my nature way,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Not the end, not the end,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
To strict party-platform ties,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Going, going,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
You got to serve somebody,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
I got two white horses following me,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Trouble,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Go away from my window,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Stone you and say good luck,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Go melt back in the night,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
God knows that, when you see it,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Father of minutes, father of days,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Every moon is so sanctified,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
May you stay forever young,
True love, they've been without it,
Tell me that you love me only,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
You could look at it and weep,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Look who's back in town,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
But I've been hanging on,
Nothing was delivered,
Or have done something wrong,
But the time ain't tall,
My love, she speaks softly,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
I went back home, put on my tie,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
I can make it through,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Too noble to neglect,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
From their fates try to resign,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Heart of mine,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
One by one they follow the sun,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Light yourself a candle,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Says he's got a bad bill,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
I'm going down the river,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
All that and more and then some,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Till both of us fell by the way,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
And forget my pride,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I got no place left to turn,
That her father was going to hang,
Tell me,
You were striped, you were plain,
The Communists was a-coming around,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I'd be sad and blue,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
And I'm just like that bird,
Laying low,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
It was a girl I learned it from,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
The joint is jumping,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Thinking about the government,
To hide 'neath a hood,
I want you so bad,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
They tell me every man must fall,
To protect his white skin,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Wintertime in New York town,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Memory, ecstasy,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
My dear, sweet friend,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
And, though the line is cut,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
I went into the city, into the town,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
But evidently she don't,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Pressing on,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
And she'll be coming forth,
To shine in through,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Like some mystery,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
But, it ain't me, babe,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Vanished from my hand,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Yet every distance is not near,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Well, the ocean took my baby,
To find out if she's talked,
God knows it's true,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Can't find what I need,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
But, to remain as friends,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
So glad,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Name of Martin Luther King,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
The night blows cold and rainy,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
And here I sit so patiently,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
In the instant that I preach,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
I'd already gone the distance,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
New morning,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I went down where the vultures feed,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Joey, Joey,
Under the microscope,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Father of cold and father of heat,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Private reasons, great or small,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Thieving in the alley,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Thank You, Lord,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Father of time and father of dreams,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Went back home to the yard,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
I'm going back to Colorado,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Bringing me all of your charms,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
On the stone that remains,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Carry the New York Times,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
It's rising up above my head,
At ships with tattooed sails,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
You've got to serve somebody,
You can raise up your right hand,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Someone to open each and every door,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
To be so useless and all,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
They don't believe in mercy,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
It all seemed so well-timed,
God sees it all unfold,
On this new morning, new morning,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
May be the head of some big TV network,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Look away, you rolling river,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
With no direction home,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I've been around this whole country,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
When I seen him lose control,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
That the laws are with him,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I just can't do what I've done before,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Don't let me change my heart,
You wanna drown love,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Face full of black soot,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Now you don't talk so loud,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
While riding on a train going west,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
As human gods aim for their mark,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Strangers all give me the news,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Someone to close his heart,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
The sky too is folding under you,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Six months on the chain gang,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Couldn't even see the floor,
All the silver, all the gold,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
But I know that he don't talk,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
By users, cheaters,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
But I would not feel so all alone,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
To stay closer than any friend,
Give what I got until I got no more,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
And give him back the time he's done,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Don't wear sandals,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
If you must cling to someone,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Make you spin or do you in,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
They say every man must need protection,
And your streets are getting empty,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
In a pine box for all eternity,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It's a price I have to pay,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
I been good while I been waiting,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
If your time to you is worth saving,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
You can stick your head in the sand,
If ever I prove false to you,
Loyalty, unity,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I got the worried blues,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
To your tambourine in time,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
To keep up his hate,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
The country music station plays soft,
In his anger and his shame,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Want you so bad,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Oh, watered-down love,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
I try my best to be just like I am,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Just then the order came to charge,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
You and me, we had completeness,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
I'm never, never far from home,
Looking for a new fool,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Advertising signs, they con,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
They run a brick and tile company,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Come all without, come all within,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
But me, I can't cover what I am,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
But now morning is clear,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Tell her not to worry,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Seven days,
To be out on your own,
When I was in Missouri,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Like you never did before,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Said I'm pressing on,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Drag you down or drain you down,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Is used, it is plain,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
She's opened up a happy home,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
God knows everything,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
You have explained every mystery,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Into my own parade,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Mercury, gravity,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
God knows there's a chance,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Watch the river flow,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Equality, liberty,
You don't have to feed me,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Serve somebody,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Courage is a thing of the past,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Says he's got a bad cough,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
For the politician's gain,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I'll be on my way,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Where life and death are memorized,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
And it's like I ain't here,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Eh, in somebody's room,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Socialism, hypnotism,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
They say every distance is not near,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
They say every man need protection,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Every brain is civilized,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
I threw it all away,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Don't try No Doz,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Ten thousand men on the move,
But I'm saved,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
But I will be back, I will survive,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
When she lays upon the grass,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
With the juice running down my leg,
In the darkness of my night,
To be––direction home,
They pass by so silently,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Oh, see what you can do,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
You have given everything to me,
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Democracy don't rule the world --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
That's where you belong --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
You give something up for everything you gain.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
And get something quick to eat.
But I would never do you wrong.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Waiting on my burying ground.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Someone's watching over you.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
In the brightness of my day.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Just what he was talking about.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
Looking for a new friend.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
Until I threw it all away.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
The sooner you can go.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
But you're not even sure what it is.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
There were six thousand people there.
In this concrete world full of souls.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
She's in some foreign land.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
To anything I might have tried.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
For the times, they are a-changing.
It'll never do, somehow.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
You're my honey.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Rain would gather too.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
The light I never knowed.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Look a-the other way.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
You're gonna need my help someday.
That linger in the fireball heat.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
They found him dead in the street one day.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Said it was a bad dream.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Or define you or confine you.
I would only let you down.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
With my suitcase in my hand.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
I needed somebody to talk to.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
I just can't beg you anymore.
I know something is changed.
I had something to protect.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Honey, come and see about me.
No kindred or relative nigh.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
I can't hear you anymore.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
If you won't come out your window.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
I see that stationmaster too.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Lost time is not found again.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
I scarcely feel the glow.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Some speak of the future.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Crumble into one another.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
The same as my father before him.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Without a love of my own.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
I'll remember you.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
In the summertime when you were with me.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Life don't mean a thing.
Chain you down or be your clown.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
Means another poor boy is underground.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
And the morning will be breaking.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
And make promises by the hours.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
By that soft and shining sea.
Sound like it's on a final run.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
On the caboose of the train.
68, but says he's 24.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Good car to drive, after a war.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
May you stay forever young.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
Just like so many times before.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
I used to care, but things have changed.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
You always got more than enough rope.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Tomorrow will be another day.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Greenwich Village.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
Yes, and I'll go last.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I been worrying about you, baby.
It always does when you're with me.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
I want everybody to be free.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Drink up your blood like wine.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
In an oil refinery.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
Fighting every inch of the way.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Put me outta doors.
The National Guard stands around the door.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
And relive my dreams.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
All because of the color of his skin.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
What looks like the easy way out.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Trust yourself.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
On this new morning with you.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
I finally got a job in New York town.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
Take it on down to give me grow.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
I don't know.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
That can win what's never been won.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Soft as music, light as spring.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
She acts like we never met.
Come on, baby...
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
But I know that I can't move.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Most of the time.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
To reach of your rattling drums.
You got it, baby.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
It ain't quite the end.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
And come away with me.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
You don't have to worry any more.
But the fighter still remains.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
They seem determined to go all the way.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Need that woman straight and true.
People bending broken rules.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
You only got ten.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Figuring a way to get back home.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
I'm going where I never been before.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
Mortality, reality.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
In the palace of the Pope.
And no time to think.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
I can't fire them anymore.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Hear me singing through these tears.
You're drifting too far from shore.
You to me were the best.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
I'll hold it down for you.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Come on, honey.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
And watch the parking meters.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
I just can't keep from crying.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
It runs both cold and deep.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
But my heart just won't give in.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
I didn't feel so cold then.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Down to New Orleans.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Watch the parking meters.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
I hope you're ready.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
An innocent man in a living hell.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
If you just let me come home with you.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
I did not do it knowingly.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
A-lord, protect my child.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Who always was too proud to beg.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
High society, notoriety.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Where teardrops fall.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Ever since I seen you there.
And pretend that we never have touched.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
See like me or be like me.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Honey, I never would have come.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
And all your raging glory.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
After losing every battle.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
Everything is gonna be alright.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
To hold me in your arms.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
You're a big girl all the way.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
That last night I was with.
That must be what it's all about.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
His mama sure was proud of him.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
All because his face was brown.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
So, darling, you better come through.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
She murdered mortal he.
Far down the street we stray.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
At the end of the trail.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Until my dying-day.

But she had some way of finding them out.
Just trying to find my little all and all.

Calling out that he's been framed.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
With the golden loom.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
To see that you're madly in love.

Come on, baby.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.

The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
I always thought that he was well.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
If I ride back again.

I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.

She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.

Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
She once was a true love of mine.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
It was you who understood.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
It sure is right on a night like this.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Now you don't talk so loud.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
Can't see over to the other side.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Blowing through another no-good town.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
Oh, convey herself away.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
It hurts me, too.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
Lay your hand upon my head.
While evening slips away.
I'm sad and lonely too.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Under the hedges.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
And it never seemed strange.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
His epitaph plain:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
But there's one promise, darling:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Yeah, serve somebody:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Till I come into New York town:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Serve somebody:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
About everybody that was hanging out;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Had to be held down by big police;
Everybody that was hanging out;
I find complete love;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Make promises by the hour;
All lies and jest;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Crumble into one another;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Some speak of the future;
So many things that we never will undo;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>

<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>

<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Gal, where you been so long?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
How long are we gonna be riding?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Am I ready?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Baby, what more can I tell?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
How many more without any reward?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
By golly, what more can I say?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
That too many people have died?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Of everything you see?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
What can I do for You?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Before he can see the sky?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Where did you lose your wings?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
How could they ever mistake you?
How can I live for You?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
How's everything in heaven?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Too many people have died?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How could they let you go?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Before they're forever banned?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Why and what's the reason for?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Who killed Davey Moore?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Why would I want to take your life?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Oh, how could you refuse?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Before you call him a man?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Before they're allowed to be free?
When he's standing in front of you?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Like a rolling stone?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
And how does it feel?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
How many compared to yesterday?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who's gonna let it roll?
For all these earthly things?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
What's wrong with you this time?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Just like a rolling stone?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Does anyone even try?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Are you ready?
Have they missed you?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
How many more can they afford?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
What else can a poor boy do?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
How much poison did they inhale?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Across the swamp of time?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
When did you leave heaven?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
How come you don't send me no regards?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Where did you hide your halo?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
What good am I?
Across the swooping plain?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Must everybody bow?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Can you get back in?
Just what in the world has come over you?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Has anybody seen my love?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
I seen better times, but who has not?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
To love and follow His direction?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
And one deserving of affection?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Baby, can't you tell?
Before he can hear people cry?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Is it rolling, Bob?
What would life be?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Did you respect me for what I did?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
What can I give to You?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
How can you say he will haunt you?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Can I come home with you?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
How does it feel?
Does he change the course of rivers?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Nothing was delivered
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
I will not go down under the ground
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
All the sweethearts you can hold
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I've been walking around
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
You used to be so amused
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Silvio, silver and gold
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
By no special friend
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Now you don't act so––so proud
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
And your trouble is you know it too good
But she ain't gonna find the road
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
I'll always thank the Lord
Now, a very great man once said
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Maybe someday you will understand
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
He wagged his tail and shook his head
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
So I'll make my stand
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
I still can remember the way that you smiled
I live in another world
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Many times I've often prayed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
But now something has changed
I run right home and I went to bed
They took a clean-cut kid
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Things would be different the next time we wed
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
And then you told me later as I apologized
I want you, baby, just to understand
You used––be so proud
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And those whom doom and death had spared
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
You try so hard, but you don't understand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Roving gambler, he was very bored
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
While some, on principles baptized
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
But something has changed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
There ain't nothing in this world
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
He was a clean-cut kid
We live in a political world
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
For what you sold that's not been received
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Just what you had in mind
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Its iron claws attached
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Now you don't seem so proud
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
I thought that it was well-understood
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
As I stand upon the sand
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
"Equality". I spoke the word
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
To see him obviously framed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
How many times can a man turn his head
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
I had to say something to strike him very weird
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Now, whenever I get up and
And into the path you are hurled
Somebody seen him hanging around
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
It's something you did
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
She let go of my hand
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
And things would be different the next time we wed
The man the authorities came to blame
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
And I ain't complaining none
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
From the start by the rule
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Says it's closing time
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Everybody's wearing a disguise
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
But I feel nothing for their game
She plunged him into well water where
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Leaving men wholly, totally free
From all the plans they do pursue
Just what you will say when you get home
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
We see this empty cage now corrode
And never sat once at the head of the table
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Waiting to find out what price
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
He'll see by his grave
Among the lovely people living free
As he rises to fame
You just pick anyone
Why wait any longer for the one you love
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
What good am I then to others and me
She been gone
I rode with him in a taxi once
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Limited in sex they dare
On the rising curve
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
You cut to the core
She knows there's no success like failure
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
They say don't come back no more
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
It'll be with me unto the grave
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
To show you something you seen before
When the roses fade
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
You into thinking you're the one
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Looking at hands for the lines that were
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
But I can get another one
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
If dogs run free, why not me
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Well, it's all new to me
And you see why it's so unique to be
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And suddenly there appeared before me
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Mona tried to tell me
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Little did I realize
From the Golden Gate Bridge
How was I to know you'd be the one
You said you'd never compromise
You smiling through the fence at me
When the rain is blowing in your face
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Just pick anyone
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Better stay away from those
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
To give the special one you seek a chance
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
And that is that one must always flush out his house
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
What's probably got you baffled more
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
But it won't be over till they clear his name
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Con you into thinking that you're the one
It's all new to me
With all memory and fate
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Remember me to the one who lives there
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Lies that life is black-and-white
Remember me to one who lives there
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Should I put them by your gate
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I'm ready for to fade
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
But I can't say I sympathize
A girl who would murder her own, true love
If dogs run free, why not we
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
I can survive and I can endure
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
You know, it's not even safe no more
But the dark does die
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Where I could watch her waltz for free
How many ears must one man have
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
If dogs run free, then what must be
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
At dawn my lover comes to me
See the primitive wallflower freeze
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
I do declare
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Should I leave them by your gate
You say you're looking for someone
The cause was there before we came
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
I'm sure you're the one to blame
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
I am homeless, come and take me
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
So up she picked her babies three
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
When I'm all alone
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
And plenty time for good romance
Though its shadow's metal badge
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
I don't even notice she gone
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
What you're gonna say when you get home
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Up into some paradise
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
What about that millionaire
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Full of hope and desire
There were times when I was so lonesome
So I remember every face
All I feel is heat and flame
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Taking care of somebody nice
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
The crashing waves roll over me
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
When Reilly's daughter got a message
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
Hunger pays a heavy price
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
"It's only you that he does crave
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
While them that defend what they cannot see
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
And the Negro's name
So I look like a walking mountain range
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
And I would send a message
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
You're not free to belong to me
I been wondering all about me
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Knows there's no success like failure
"That I might be gone a long, old time
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
So, I called up the operator of time
That she's the same one
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
A bed that is never mine
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
You could almost think that you're seeing double
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
The order is rapidly fading
What am I saying? What am I knowing
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
If I was with her too long
And there's no telling who that it's naming
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
For your weary toes to be touching
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Beyond here lies nothing
For your weary toes to be a-touching
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And the cards are no good that you're holding
They're drinking up and walking
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
But then a whistle will be blowing
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
There's nothing in here moving
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Well, I set my monkey on the log
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Deceived me into thinking
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Where the time and the tempo drag
The battle outside raging
The order is a-rapidly fading
It's not a bad way to make a living
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
'Cause the battle outside raging
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Early in the morning, early in the morning
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
She rode by night and came by morning
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Look out, the saints are coming through
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And how I know I'll make it through
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I have fallen far beneath
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
You go north and you go south
Then she told us how times were tough
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Shoot in the back
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
You turn around to take a final peek
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Well, there ain't no going back
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
But they caught him and they brought him back
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
The man in me will do nearly any task
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Her voice once and talk
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
I wish she'd unlock
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
They ask me how I feel
Muttering small talk at the wall
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
He's taught in his school
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Ring bar, hard to tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
How many seas must a white dove sail
Oh, how does it feel
All and all can only fall
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Ring bell, hard to tell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
How does it feel
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
And if my love is real
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Soul to soul our shadows roll
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
A girl by the whirlpool
He's sure got a lot of gall
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
But among the dead that were left on the hill
How many seas must the white dove sail
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
As the last fire-truck from hell
A-how does it feel
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
I chased me a woman up the hill
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Then why don't she tell
Now, they asked me to read a poem
You better not chew gum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And remain as I am
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But I can hear another drum
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
So, one morning when the sun was warm
"For you cannot relive them
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Two eyes took the aim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
But the post office has been stolen
That long, black train is pulling on down
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Their religion of the little ten women
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
And she aches just like a woman
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Trying to get a lead on
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
She got such a sweet disposition
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
The next morning she had awoken
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
All their daughters put me down
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Have died in battle or in vain
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Please don't let on that you knew me when
There was little to say, there was no conversation
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
You need something to make it known
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
You don't need a weatherman
Suicide remarks are torn
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Advertising signs that con
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
My love, she's like some raven
But all their daughters put me down
Nothing we can call our own
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
And all their daughters put me down
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
To my knowledge there's just one man
But me, I expected it to happen
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
The ones that jump on the wagon
And she wakes just like a woman
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
In ceremonies of the horsemen
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
He got that fortress on the mountain
To remember the times when I was your only man
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Yet I swear I see my reflection
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
From heights that they could not gain
You take just like a woman
And you ache a-just like a woman
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Guns and clubs followed him down
But it's hard to think on
But the second mom was with the seventh son
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Must meet the dawn
She takes just like a woman
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
For the loser now might be later to win
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
How can the life of such a man
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no exit in any direction
The foreign sun, it squints upon
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
In the pigpen
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
She said that all the railroad men
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
For the loser now will be later to win
And the corner sign
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Out of the shower comes a football man
That long, black train is pulling down
Darkness at the break of noon
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Yes, and someone must explain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
I figure maybe we're even
Somebody new to beat on
Uncle Rat went running downtown
But the second mother was with the seventh son
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Well, you fake just like a woman
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Well, I'm hanging on
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
But I swear I see my reflection
A-she takes just like a woman
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
"Not me," said the gambling man
Why did you trade heaven
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
How many roads must a man walk down
I'll be waiting at the station
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
There's nothing you can say or do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
All I'd like you to do
All I really wanna do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Every place I wanna go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
There is a place you go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Silvio, I gotta go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Aladdin and his lamp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
The man in the coon-skin cap
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
How many times must a man look up
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
What good am I while you softly weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
The face of God will appear
The lover who has just walked out your door
I say, "Why you say that for
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
At any moment you could go under
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
When you whispered in my ear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Still I say her love-words over
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Never no more do I wonder
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
So, don't fear if you hear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
The wind howls like a hammer
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
And I don't even think about her
I could feel a whole lot better
But morning is clear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
For I am married to a house carpenter
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
For all eternity I think I will remember
I close my eyes and I wonder
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
You heard me saying a prayer for
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Alone you stand with nobody near
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
When only you are near
Still I've always kind of missed her
Who came here from Cuba's door
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
She took him by his long, yellow hair
In one I was running and in another
I don't have to go far
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
My ship is in the harbor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
All you boys better run for cover
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
The cowboy angel rides
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
You know that he has no intentions
And the poor white remains
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Six-time users
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
You should be made to wear earphones
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
But still remains
That it's you and no one else that owns
They whisper in the wings
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
True love can make a blade of grass
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
I'd gladly confess
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
To sharpen the senses
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
As friends and other strangers
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Don't wear sandals
People on the platforms
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
I'm gonna let you pass
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
You can fall down on your knees
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
What good am I if I say foolish things
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And, though the masters make the rules
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
"Not me," said the man whose fists
But, though the masters make the rules
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Girl by the whirlpool's
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And your father, to your sister he explains
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
To the cutting of fences
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Wants eleven dollar bills
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
People carry roses
Glide across the lonely years
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
How many deaths will it take till he knows
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
You been hurt so many times
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Now, you must provide some answers
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Well, the ragman draws circles
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Her window's wide open, African trees
To memorizing politics
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
And then complains
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
And I try to harmonize with songs
I try to tell it like it is
With a big bouquet of the roses
I was thinking of a series of dreams
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Romantic facts of musketeers
We living in times when men commit crimes
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Seven days
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
And so Patty calls the cops
Statues made of matchsticks
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Good and bad, I define these terms
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Thinking of a series of dreams
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Don't follow leaders
He's not selling any alibis
Six-time losers
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
At times I think there are no words
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
With a fantastic collection of stamps
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
And tells me of her dreams
And the princess and the prince discuss
Without any doubt
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Plants in the bed, but
I'm moving after midnight
You used to laugh about
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
They tell me to be discreet
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Talking that the heat put
To hold each other tight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Keep it in your mind and not forget
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
But, if the arrow is straight
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
In the stillness of the midnight
One more night I will wait for the light
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
In the precious winds they rot
You're gonna get hit
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
I got into the driver's seat
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
He really wasn't where it's at
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
The slowest now will later be fast
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Keep me set apart
Everyone still talks about
With your pockets well protected at last
He built a fire on Main Street
The slow one now will later be fast
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
How many years can a mountain exist
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
There's some people that
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
One more night the moon is shining bright
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
And the first one now will later be last
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I soon get some rest
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
We can hold up a toast if we meet
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
They tell me revenge is sweet
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Someday, everything is gonna be different
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
You're hearing my heart beat
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
You don't forget
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Johnny's in the basement
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Wait for the morning light
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
She seems too far out
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Our Father would not like the way that you act
I think that it's best
So he never thinks straight
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
You used to laugh–make fun about
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Everything is always right
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
It don't take too long to find out
How many years can some people exist
And, since my feet are now fast
You are there in the flickering light
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
That might be all that you got
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
By the way, that's a cute hat
And I, in my armor, turning about
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
I'm on the pavement
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To protect you and defend you
I can be just like you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
And I tell this truth to you
To be alone with you
I just might have to come see you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Down every street there's a window
The only one I know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
With only you in view
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
But sooner or later one of us must know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
He been living there three years now
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
It only goes to show
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Don't it always a-go to show
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Well, I'd sure like to know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Don't it always go to show
Now, you're probably wondering by now
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
She knocked upon it anyway
That I done it the way
And that which you've given me today
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Though I'd never say
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
I did not do it harmfully
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
And it's up to you to say
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
But I can't deny
So I run down most hurriedly
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
That I was just a puppet in a play
I send you all my money
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
But I wish there was something you would do or say
The Spanish-American War had its day
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
She smiles, walks the other way
Well, I'm walking down the highway
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Or if you just want some company
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Is worth more than I could pay
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
So, I'm walking down your highway
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
She puts it to me plain as day
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
For them that think death––death's honesty
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
To those condemned to act accordingly
And the only tune my guitar could play
Spouted out that liberty
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Went to the doctor the very next day
But you can never steal away
For them that must obey authority
Someone to get you flowers constantly
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
He made the bells of freedom ring today
No, you'll not now or no other day
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
My mind weaves a symphony
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
My ears hear a symphony
Maggie says that many say
From phony jealousy
She starts to speak, but he walks away
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
A cock is crowing far away
If I don't take the chance to try
And for His love they took His life away
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
And the ladies treat me kindly
The same thing I would want today
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Don't you tell Henry
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
So they took him to the infirmary
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
For them that think death's honesty
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
We banged the drum slowly
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
As suicide remarks are torn –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Oh, my–
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
You will not hear a laugh –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Private reasons – great or small –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I hope that you can hear––
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
First degree and second degree –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Whispering your secret emotion –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Disconnect these cables––
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
I a-hope you can hear––
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
How badly they were shocked –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Hang out the whole next day –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Havana–gee–
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Ten thousand miles or more –
With no other choice except but for to go –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Hava–na–
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
I'm sure it was not three –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Havanagee–luh–
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Indians camp along her border –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Leave all the children home –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
To know where you are –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
I long to hold you in the night –
I got no idea what I want –
Ha–va–
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
