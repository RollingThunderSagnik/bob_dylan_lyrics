He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Dignity never been photographed!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
So long, New York!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!

You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!

Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!

Good God!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Woo-hoo!

All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Betty Ross!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Alright, now!
Goodnight!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
Oh, no!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
How they ever flood my soul!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!

This place don't make sense to me no more!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!

Looking for my lo and behold!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
He punched me out!
Start over!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
I ain't different than anyone!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Thank you!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Them Reds did it!
Play that guitar now!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
I've got a million friends!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Take me down to California, baby!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Yeah, man!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Oh, yeah!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
It was the mailman!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Yes, come out your window!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
You must think I'm crazy!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Well!
They was all over!
I've got the freight train blues!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
She's insane!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
They got away!
Hope I don't find out too much!
I got the freight train blues!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
Yippee!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Woo!
I figured they was in my TV set!
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Country'll grow."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
We'll both go home together."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
I'll endow them onto thee."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
But we were tangled up in blue."
It's all for the love of thee."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
I didn't see you around."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
And have it on Highway 61."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
And hung on a willow tree."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You must know about my debutante."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
I can't find my knees."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
"That way down Highway 61."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
We want folksingers here."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
They look as dark as night."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
And punched my cigarette."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Come flowing down so free?"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
So write to her tenderly."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
"I've had too much of your company,"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
He said, "Tell me about it."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
I would want again tomorrow."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
Tangled up in blue."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
Will mourn for your return."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
That you must always first forgive them."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
For that reason I will have to stay."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Get on your horse and ride away."
And it's all for the love of thee."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
We'll both go off together."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
You and I'll never know."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
But I know what you want."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
I'll bring back my lady."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
"Is it easy to forget?"
Where you and I will unite."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
You can't blame us at all."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Would kill a little bird like me."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
And keep him good company."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
I'll see her soon, I know."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
You can't blame me at all."
And pretend that you never have met."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"Have you seen dignity?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
I love far better than thee."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Have it on Highway 61."
They look as white as snow."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I went into the city, into the town,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
I'd be sad and blue,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
To be without a home,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
The night would see me wide awake,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Waiting for the trains,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
You have given all there is to give,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
He's young and on fire,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
All that and more and then some,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
I know I can't win,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Get born, keep warm,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
With no direction home,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Don't mind the driving rain,
And it ain't me, babe,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
We'll fly the night away,
When I was in Missouri,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Joey, Joey,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
That fellow who never blushes,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
One summer's day he came passing by,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
How he died nobody can say,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
To hang and to lynch,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
And you know I could never be your own,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Want you so bad,
It always means so much,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
They––they show me to the door,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
I get my sweet reward,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
She's opened up a happy home,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
The day you quit me, baby,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
In one the surface was frozen,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
You have given me eyes to see,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Someone to close his heart,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
With what your fate is going to be,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Dream about you, baby,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Make you spin or do you in,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
In the lonely night,
But, if I can save you any time,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
And on the highway of regret,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
To stay closer than any friend,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
I been good while I been waiting,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Honey, just for you to climb,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
You and me, we had completeness,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Who will promise never to part,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Out to the windy beach,
I went into the city, went into the town,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Into my own parade,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
In the end,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
While riding on a train going west,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
But it ain't me, babe,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Drifting too far from shore,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
A hand set the spark,
Yesterday is just a memory,
It's alright,
Yet every distance is not near,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I just say no thanks,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Tears on the letter that I write,
And to come each time you call,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
They say every distance is not near,
But, to remain as friends,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
It's rising up above my head,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Don't let me change my heart,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
People going down to the ground,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I've been saved – well, alright,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
In the little church a-this side of town,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
And there's two white horses following me,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Analyze you, categorize you,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
We live in a political world,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Hold me, baby, be near,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
They tell me every man must fall,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
She said she would always stay,
Madams light the candles,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Made before the foundation of the world,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Broken cutters, broken saws,
All I really wanna do,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Don't let yourself fall,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I like the way that you move your hips,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
I can't understand,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Baby, let me follow you down,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
But I'm pressing on,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
You to me were true,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
It don't matter what you did,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
God knows everything,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
I got no place left to turn,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
But the bottles are done,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Courage is a thing of the past,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
It's a price I have to pay,
True love of mine,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Love that's pure no accident,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Look out, kid,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
The sky too is folding under you,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
God knows there's a chance,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
I fell down to my bended knees,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I have no one to meet,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
That can do what's never been done,
And give him back the time he's done,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
To your tambourine in time,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Just like a rolling stone,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
You got to serve somebody,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
To be one your own,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
The man in the trench-coat,
Nothing too very scientific,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Badge out, laid off,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Father of day, father of night,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Oh, you want watered-down love,
I shall be released,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
But the time ain't tall,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
And, although that we're single and free,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Far away and over the wall,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Tell me that you love me only,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Don't matter what you did,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
God knows it's terrifying,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Private reasons, great or small,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
A man with a badge skips by,
When she lays upon the grass,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
God knows there's a river,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Watching the river flow,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Just don't know what to do,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
I found my world, found my world in you,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
If you can't quit your sinning,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Drag you down or drain you down,
Human gods aim for their mark,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
A worried man with a worried mind,
And here I sit so patiently,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
We've killed each one,
Like a rolling stone,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Watch the river flow,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Trouble,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Try hard, get barred,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
There's always someone who understands,
Well, I can't understand,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
God knows how to make it flow,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Heart of mine, go back home,
By losers, cheaters,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Mixing up the medicine,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Every brain is civilized,
I'm leaving today,
Silhouetted by the sea,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
And it's like I ain't here,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
She would have married me,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
To a solid rock,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
And to come every time you call,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Father of time and father of dreams,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Now you don't talk so loud,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Tell her not to worry,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Better jump down the manhole,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
And it's only that I'm asking,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
You made it there somehow,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
I'd give you the sky high above,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
A complete unknown,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
I just don't see why I should even care,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
I'll be on my way,
That can do what's a-never been done,
One by one they follow the sun,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
The path you've endured has been rough,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Don't wear sandals,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
The Second World War came to an end,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Maybe when we both get sober,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
That her father was going to hang,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Searching everywhere I know,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
In the darkness of my night,
Had no one to go my bail,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
I just can't do what I've done before,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
To be out on your own,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
The angels play on their horns all day,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
How he died nobody could say,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Well, I don't mind dying,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Since you've been gone,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Pick you up every time you fall,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Laying low,
True love, they've been without it,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
As human gods aim for their mark,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
In the great unknown,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
God knows it's outta sight,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
With his fist in a clinch,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I went into the red, went into the black,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
And you make love just like a woman,
Eh, singing just for you,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Better jump down a manhole,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
King of the streets, child of clay,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Look who's back in town,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Said I'm pressing on,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Broken lines, broken strings,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
You don't have to feed me,
You can run down to the desert,
Winter would have no spring,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
You better chew gum,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
As his youth now unfolds,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
On this new morning, new morning,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Staying far behind without you,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Don't try No Doz,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
I want you so bad,
God knows that, when you see it,
She never does me wrong,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
But it would not be new,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Oh, watered-down love,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
If she ain't feeling well,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
And comes to a permanent stop,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
God don't call it treason,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Without your sweet love,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
A thousand miles from home,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Saved,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
My limbs are shaking,
On the stone that remains,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
And think they're fooling you,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
We take great delight in our own company,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Father of loneliness and pain,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
This world is ruled by violence,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I rambled out of New York town,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Searching high, searching low,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
They say every man needs protection,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
For the wise men and the fools,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
I went down where the vultures feed,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
As the present now will later be past,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
May be living in another country under another name,
You will be alright, girl,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
A man named Martin Luther King,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Face full of black soot,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Seem like I been down this way before,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
I'm going out of my mind,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Living in the land of Nod,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
The one we can see and can feel,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
You wanna drown love,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Alright, I'm so glad,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
One by one until there were none,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
You had enough of hatred,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Friends with you,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
That fired the gun,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Judge and jury took their stand,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
But now morning is clear,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
And every cause that ever I fought,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
So I got those worries blues,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
To know how much I really care,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Holding his club like he was a king,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
I want my arms around you,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
When I seen him lose control,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
It was from her ship sailing,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Don't let me drift too far,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I bless the day I found you,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
This situation can only get rougher,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
My arms and legs were broken,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
God knows you've got to weep,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
May be an actor in a plot,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
But you try with your whole soul,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
You'll change your last name, too,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Just as long as you stay with me,
The man there said he loved my sound,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
It's too bad he had to go,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Watered-down love,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Oh, Angelina,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Wintertime in New York town,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I got two white horses following me,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Need a woman all the time,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
If today was not a crooked highway,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
I once held her in my arms,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Keep me where you are,
I just don't know what to do,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Heart of mine,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Looking for a new fool,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Nothing was delivered,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
The night passed away so quickly,
She'll be coming forth,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
I got those worried blues,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Over your senses you have no control,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
The kingdoms of experience,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
And I'm back in the rain,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Try to be a success,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Stripping away at it all,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
I landed up on the downtown side,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Never needed to call you my whore,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Well, I'm so glad,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Pressing on,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Don't tie no bows,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
But I'm saved,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
He's the property of Jesus,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
I can change, I swear,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
I just keep pressing on,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
I can't cross the line, you know,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
I don't care if you analyze me,
You can raise up your right hand,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Mercury, gravity,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
You were striped, you were plain,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Just to know that you are near,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
That must be what it's all about,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Four by four, no illusion for,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
You have explained every mystery,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
The day would surely have to break,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
They say every man must fall,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
I'm going down the river,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
I need a shot of love,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Never weak, but always strong,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
It's really something,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Strike another match, go start anew,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Read books, repeat quotations,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
And the whole world is on your case,
The light I never knowed,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
The carpet too is moving under you,
If'n you don't know by now,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
But I've been hanging on,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
If you throw it all away,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
People carry roses,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Look away, you rolling river,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
The country music station plays soft,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
But you were gambling for support,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
And also by his feet,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Too serious to fool,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
My love, she speaks like silence,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Is used, it is plain,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
But something has changed,
Aim well, my little one,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Go melt back in the night,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
It's like I ain't here,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Light yourself a candle,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Dust on my face and my cape,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Simplify you, classify you,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Under the microscope,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
She's crying like an evil stone,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Oh, singing just for you,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
And not going through any great extreme,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Come all without, come all within,
And played the fife lowly,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Give you my money, honey,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
The train leaves at half past ten,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
With the juice running down my leg,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
With a killer's pride, security,
You're beautiful beyond words,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Loyalty, unity,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Not the end, not the end,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Don't let her know,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
You gotta look some other place,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I thank the Lord,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
They say every man need protection,
But, if you want me to,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Far away from it all,
God sees it all unfold,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Trust yourself,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Grandpa died last week,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
She'll surely turn to white,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
"Come along and take a trip,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
She leave by the other and roam,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
They keep it all hid,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Love don't have any place,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Don't let her hear,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
May you stay forever young,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
And the point is slick,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Over the hills and far away,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
My love, she speaks softly,
Tell me,
They must bust in early May,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
I wish I a-was a magician,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
If I didn't have to guess,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Of this I can't say very much,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Beyond here lies nothing,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
To be alone with you,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
You could look at it and weep,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Like as not, it's better so,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
I got my mind made up,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
You got something I want plenty of,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
And may you stay forever young,
You can hear them tires squeal,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
I got a wife and five little children,
Far away in the stormy night,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Don't know what to do without it,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
So, never leave me lonely,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
At the close of the day,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
We'll go someplace unknown,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Eh, see what you can do,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Come on, come on, stick together,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Well, well, well,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I try my best to be like I am,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Every nerve is analyzed,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
All the silver, all the gold,
The haunted, frightened trees,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
But, if I will save you the time,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Well, I may just swear,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
You want watered-down love,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
You got something better,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Bring the wife and family,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
To find out if she's talked,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
When there is no more,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
But he's the property of Jesus,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Is it really any wonder,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
But evidently she don't,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
When all will be well,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
If you'd see me this way,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
You have given me life to live,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
God knows there's a purpose,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
One by one they followed the sun,
They don't believe in mercy,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Day you quit me, baby,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
I long to see you in the morning light,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Seven days,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Carry the New York Times,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Speaking to some French girl,
I should have left this town this morning,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
New morning,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Father of black, father of white,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
And, though the line is cut,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
For her to arrive,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Hazel, you called and I came,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Someone to open each and every door,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
I got the worried blues,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
I just can't beg you anymore,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Of ancient history,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
For all intended purposes,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Looking 'bout the government,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
She once was a true love of mine,
Like a dog on a chain,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
They took a clean-cut kid,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
That the laws are with him,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
But he can't be blamed,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Ooh, watered-down love,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
They say that every man must fall,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
People talk over situations,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
He is centuries old,
Don't let her see where you're going,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Precious memories, how they linger,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
And I got the worried blues,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
"Not I," said the referee,
But ye shall be a-changed,
In the instant that I preach,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
I been riding the midnight train,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
A million faces at my feet,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Well, the job that you used to have,
I'll go see them come down my way,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
I got a bird that whistles,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
I can see the turning of the key,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Vanished from my hand,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
You're beautiful to me,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Icicles hanging down,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Gonna serve somebody,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
I'm going back to Colorado,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Like some mystery,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
I swung on to my old guitar,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
And gathering storms may arise,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
You stole her love from me one day,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
I never can go because, you know,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Broken switches, broken gates,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
God knows when,
I'd only have to stay,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
To be so useless and all,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Front door shut, back door too,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
And furnish me with tape,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
And you take just like a woman,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Read books and repeat quotations,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Automobile coming into style,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Precious father, loving mother,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
They say every man must need protection,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
He got that soft, silky skin,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
My senses have been stripped,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Stay away from the train line,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
It hurts me, too,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Newspapermen eating candy,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
But I know that he don't talk,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
By rivers of blindness,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
My dear, sweet friend,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Never did feel this way before,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Hang around the ink-well,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Going, going,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
A handle hid out in the dark,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
They pass by so silently,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
I been good,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Don't ever try to change me,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Serve somebody,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
And I'm just like that bird,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
For something that he never done,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Five by five they tried to survive,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Forever young, forever young,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
A true love of mine,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Get dressed, get blessed,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
You were snow, you were rain,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Stone you and say good luck,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
A dream about you, baby,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Stand up straight and tall,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
In the turning of twilight,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
For she ain't the same,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,

Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,

Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
And come every time you call,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Don't follow leaders,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,

High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Ever since I been a child,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
No direction home,
And point away from the past,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
She said she would never forget,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
While paupers change possessions,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,

And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,

Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Or select you or dissect you,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
No, nothing was delivered,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Strangers all give me the news,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
She got great big hind legs,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
And, if anybody asks me,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
The only son of God Almighty,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Thank You, Lord,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
The midnight rain follows the train,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Someone to close his eyes for you,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Going home,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
God don't call it wrong,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
Now, won't you tell me true,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Ten thousand men on the move,
And I'm in the shade,
You need something to open up a new door,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
To protect his white skin,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
You need something to open your eyes,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
In another I witnessed a crime,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Don't put yourself over the line,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Just like I did before,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
It still ain't me, babe,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
In his anger and his shame,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
The joint is jumping,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
But it ain't him to blame,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Circled by the circus sands,
Oh, in somebody's room,
I would not feel so all alone,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I want you,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
You've got to serve somebody,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
And, if I see the day,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
But you're doing it again,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Don't you tell Henry,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
If ever I prove false to you,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
And forget my pride,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
You'll be doing society a favor,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
To be––direction home,
Resent him to the bone,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Got my mind made up,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
To have––be on your own,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
But, deep inside my heart,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
And she'll be coming forth,
Six months on the chain gang,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I love you, pretty baby,
And, if I can save you any time,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
First degree and second degree,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Corrina, Corrina,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
The winter would hold no spring,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Relationships of ownership,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
There she come, now, down my way,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
God knows there's a heaven,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Poor boy never say die,
To strict party-platform ties,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
I had so much left to do,
The country doctor rambles,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Ye shall be changed,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
"Not me," said his manager,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
I can make it through,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Ain't no going back,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Everything's a-hers or his,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
And pretend that we never have touched,
They walk among the stately trees,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Going,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
To gather flowers constantly,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
The sky too is folding over you,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Carved next to his name,
I march in the parade of liberty,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
They run a brick and tile company,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Using every angle under the sun,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
One more night the stars are in sight,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
If not for you,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I'm so glad,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Heart of mine, be still,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Without a dream in my heart,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
They lowered him down as a king,
Where life and death are memorized,
Father of night, father of day,
Don't wanna be a bum,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
I ain't looking to block you up,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
And I got those worried blues,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
So unknown,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
I threw it all away,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Precious angel under the sun,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Get back, write Braille,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
That you'd have liked me to,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Three angels up above the street,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
God knows it's a crime,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
The beat is pumping,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Without ideals or violence,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Who could they get to carry you,
Thieving in the alley,
Advertising signs, they con,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
I wish tonight were here,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
It could even be like a myth,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Made of silver or of golden,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Memory, ecstasy,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Is looking for a new fool,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Equality, liberty,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
How does it feel,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
God knows you ain't pretty,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
You married young just like your ma,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
And your streets are getting empty,
Where I will always be renewed,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
The Communists was a-coming around,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
I won't have my nature way,
Go away from my window,
Don't let her see,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I think we better talk this over,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
China doll, alcohol,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Yes, I want you so bad,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Couldn't even see the floor,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Like you never did before,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Each time we meet, love,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Already the fiesta has begun,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Going, going, gone,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
You have given everything to me,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
My woman needs it every day,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Want you,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Keep a clean nose,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Something about you that I can't shake,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
It was you who came right through,
All them prophets good and gone,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Don't let yourself stumble,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
From their fates try to resign,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
A question in your nerves is lit,
I can finish this alone, honey,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
More people kept a-piling on,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
If you must cling to someone,
He's not selling any alibis,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Up and down the block,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
I'd already gone the distance,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Silvio, I gotta go,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
He been around the world and back again,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Too noble to neglect,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
By users, cheaters,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
To shine in through,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Hmm, see what you can do,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Without a love of my own,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
For the politician's gain,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Baby, please stop crying,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
God knows it's a struggle,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Like a complete unknown,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
All you can do is do what you must,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
You even make love just like a woman,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Father of air and father of trees,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Just then the order came to charge,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Or have done something wrong,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Why she did go,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
See you fly or watch you die,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
And I'm so glad,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
If anything is gonna sell,
The air is getting hotter,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
My hands can't feel to grip,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
People talk of situations,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
To keep up his hate,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
In love and with kindness,
He won't do nothing to you,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Each one playing a horn,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
They say everything can be replaced,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Democracy don't rule the world --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
That's where you belong --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
And that failure's no success at all.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Have fallen from her curls.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
Mortality, reality.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
I just can't see through it anymore.
And the pearls are from Japan.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Never will want for money.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
And the night blows rainy.
He's always on trial for just being born.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
And gives it to me for a song.
But simply because it's true.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
At not getting their money's worth.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
I got a bird that sings.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
Epitome, rigidity.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
A man named Martin Luther King...
So the radio didn't work so well.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Drink up your blood like wine.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
People bending broken rules.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Or put up against the wall.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.

I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.

You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Just crying out that he was framed.
When I run outta things to investigate.

I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
We may not make it through the night.
Adiós, mi corazón.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Some speak of the future.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.

She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.

I hope you're ready.

Oh, Angelina.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Sweet lady.

The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.

And tapestry of rhyme.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Blowing like my woman's on board.

He was never known to make a foolish move.
About an old man that never done wrong.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.

And the marshals and cops get the same.
Behind a man's brain.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.

Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.

Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Everybody that was hanging out.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.

Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
All because his face was brown.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Feel further away than ever before.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
That old ship was a-going down.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Rain would gather too.
Baby, let me follow you down.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
For the times, they are a-changing.
And the sails are spread.
You don't have to worry any more.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.

Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.

Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Far down the street we stray.

Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Know not what the years may hold.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.

To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
You break your promise all over the place.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.

Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Trust yourself.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
But it was more than I could do.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Please let me ride you home.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
And wait for succeeding kings.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
Ever since I seen you there.
Honey, baby.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
As if a wedding vow.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I shall be released.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Mama, you are on my mind.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
I don't know.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Rode slowly back again.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Evidently she won't.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
We all know for sure that it's real.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
To which a scoundrel clings.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
I'm a poet, I know it.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
And laid his life on the line.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Things will be alright by and by.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
That's the day you die.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
I just go pump on it some.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Looking for the places only they would know.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
The same as my father before him.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
When my memory is not so short.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
For she once was a true love of mine.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
And ye shall be changed.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
For as long as love will last.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
You know the song in my heart.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
The last radio is playing.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Where teardrops fall.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Girls like birds fly away.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
The whole world is my throne.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
And come away with me.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
You are on the bottom.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Mama, you been on my mind.
I once held her in my arms.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Soft as music, light as spring.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Buildings going up to the sky.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
"And light on my right knee.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
To hold me in your arms.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Gonna serve somebody.
And guarded them as they fell.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
You know, I loved her just the same.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Leave no stone unturned.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Saying wants company.
And then unto eternity.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
But these to tell what's true.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
And your golden loom.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Suffering like a fool.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
Life don't mean a thing.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
By the saving grace that's over me.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
You're the only love I've ever known.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
That I really did try to get close to you.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
I been worrying about you, baby.
It only brings me sorrow.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
Trying to create a next world war.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
I want you.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
It hurts me, too.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
You got it, baby.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
So many people I never saw in my life.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
My baby took my heart from me.
Remember me to one who lives there.
My love winks, she does not bother.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Come on, darling.
Ever since I seen her smile.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
I'm younger than that now.
The sooner you can leave.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
It always does when you're with me.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Lay dead beside him there.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Crumble into one another.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Blood on your saddle.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
With the glory that is to be.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
The night will soon be gone.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
Nothing done and nothing said.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Hear me singing through these tears.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
When she's better only time'll tell.
To keep her from the howling winds.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
Kisses she gave him three.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Hope that it don't sleet.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
68, but says she's 24.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
It's just the old American way.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.

Means another poor boy is underground.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
And you only got ten.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Down to New Orleans.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Bid farewell forever.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
I've seen trouble all my days.
"And stay all night with me.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.

Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
He's only a pawn in their game.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.

Wanna save my money and rip it up.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
I'll only let you down.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Oh, yes, they did.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
I froze right to the bone.
And she had left him to die in there.
I always thought that he was well.
Crying out that he was framed.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
But you were tangled up in blue.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
But my heart just won't give in.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.

All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.

Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
I followed the winding stream.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.

Said it was a bad dream.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Good as I been to you.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Nobility, humility.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.

Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
Either one of us could do what we do best.

Waiting on my burying ground.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
To be alone with you.

Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.

So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
I can't shoot them anymore.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.

Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Just like so many times before.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
From my toes up to my ears.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.

Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
You always got more than enough rope.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Everything is gonna be fine.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
But you're back where you belong.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
Tangled up in blue.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Some place so high above the wall.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Your son is coming back from the war.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Tell me.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
But I ain't neither one.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Who says she knows me well.
With my suitcase in my hand.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
And the mailbox is locked.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
I need a shot of love.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Without a love of my own.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Broken voices on broken phones.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
In the brightness of my day.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Not always easy kicking someone out, gotta wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Until my dying-day.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Fighting every inch of the way.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
And rivers that ran through every day.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Need that woman straight and true.
To kill with no pain.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Without this love that we call ours.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.

Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.

Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.

And ye shall be a-changed.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
That keep us so tightly bound.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
I'll remember you.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
That Johanna's not here.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
No kindred or relative nigh.
That's really and truly an American.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.

If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
If you won't come out your window.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.

At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Gal, you're on my mind.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
There were six thousand people there.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Funny way to start a picnic.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
You don't want me, give my money back.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
At the end of the trail.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
A true love of mine.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
I'd like to know.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Or stay all night with thee.
And one day he came passing by.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Lord, protect my child.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Or inspect you or reject you.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Find out something only dead men know.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Well, I'm just thumping.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
And shot it fulla holes.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
You left me standing out in the cold.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
With the golden loom.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
The National Guard stands around the door.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
Police at your back.
That linger in the fireball heat.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
68, but says he's 24.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
By that soft and shining sea.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
He's the neighborhood bully.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
And get something quick to eat.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Under the midnight moon.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
That last night I was with.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Just you and me.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
May you stay forever young.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Join the army if you fail.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
Drifting too far from shore.
Unless they're from another world.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Lay your hand upon my head.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
You can show me a new place to start.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
I took some comfort there.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
I hope I'm ready.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
It ain't quite the end.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
I's looking around just to see myself.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Is just equality in school.
Heart of mine.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Your voice was all that I heard.
See him at play makes me smile.
My baby stole my heart from me.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
You have no idea what you do to me.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Blowing through another no-good town.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
It don't matter, anyhow.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Hoping you'll come through too.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
He gone north for a while.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
High society, notoriety.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
But he sure left here in style.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Magic in a magical land.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
Must be and that is all.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
If you just let me come home with you.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
They got – all got outta here any way they could, cold rain can give you the shivers.
And it is time for me to slide.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
The place that I started from.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
To see that you're madly in love.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
Or define you or confine you.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
And I need you, ah.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
It don't matter anyhow.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Just remember that death is not the end.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
He could die happily ever after.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Oh, her darling love she found.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
And keep away from pranks.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
I'm going where I never been before.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.

She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
To the old folks' home and the college.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
I said that.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.

Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Baby, baby.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.

But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
You're my baby.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Go lightly on the ground.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I stood wondering which way to go.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Watch the parking meters.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.

She pretends like we never have met.
If you just let me follow you down.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
If not for you.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.

Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
To make me think I'm wrong.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
Someone I really could care for.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
And crime don't have a face.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
When I'm alone with you.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
I can't fight them anymore.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
The country doctor rambles.
And try to avoid the scandals.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
And you must realize the danger.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
I see better days and I do better things.
A foreign sound to your ear.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
You sound like a hillbilly.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
Precious memories flood my soul.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.

I'll flip the channel to number four.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Honey, I want you.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
And watch the parking meters.
And no time to think.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
Chain you down or bring you down.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Our chances really was a million to one.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
The next day could be your last.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
I would only let you down.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
There was nobody around.
I never saw the man again.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
You were always so close and still within reach.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
For me to return to or chase.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
But she had some way of finding them out.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
See that my grave is kept clean.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
I had so little time to fail.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
Just like you've always smiled before.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
In the pale moonlight.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Valentines can't buy her.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Turned on my record player.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
You're gonna need my help someday.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
But I know that I can't move.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
Is when I'm alone with you.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
I can't fire them anymore.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
I know you always say that you agree.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Until I threw it all away.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
I used to care, but things have changed.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Someone who will die for you and more.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
When you go your way and I go mine.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
When you made everybody pay.
There's a guy I gotta see.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Going back where we come from.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Greenwich Village.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
But you're not even sure what it is.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
Is gonna be against the law.
And each one I've never seen again.
Where I was born and partly raised.
And every window made of glass.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Rain would gather, too.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Yes, and I'll go last.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
And I was brought up by my brother.
But mine was a little different, you see.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
My face you'll never see no more.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
"Don't point your finger at me.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
Man is opposed to fair play:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
But there's one promise, darling:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Serve somebody:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
His epitaph plain:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Till I come into New York town:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Some speak of the future;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Crumble into one another;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
So many things that we never will undo;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
All lies and jest;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
I find complete love;
Make promises by the hour;
Had to be held down by big police;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<p>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
How come you don't send me no regards?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Baby, can't you tell?
Does he change the course of rivers?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
So I can know if I'm really real?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Baby, can I come home with you?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
And how does it feel?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Just like a rolling stone?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
I seen better times, but who has not?
How much poison did they inhale?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
When did you leave heaven?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
What can I do for You?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
When he's standing in front of you?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
By golly, what more can I say?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Baby, what more can I tell?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
For all these earthly things?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Where did you lose your wings?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Have they missed you?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Too many people have died?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Gal, where you been so long?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Before you call him a man?
Where did you hide your halo?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Why would I want to take your life?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
How can I live for You?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Across the swamp of time?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
What would life be?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
What else can a poor boy do?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Who's gonna let it roll?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Does anyone even try?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Before he can see the sky?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Can you get back in?
Why and what's the reason for?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Of everything you see?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
What good am I?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Must everybody bow?
How long are we gonna be riding?
How many more without any reward?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
And one deserving of affection?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
That too many people have died?
How does it feel?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
The love that a stranger might receive?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
How many more can they afford?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
How can you say he will haunt you?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Across the swooping plain?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
To love and follow His direction?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Can I come home with you?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
What can I give to You?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
How could they let you go?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Who you thought you were talking to?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
How could they ever mistake you?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Has anybody seen my love?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Oh, how could you refuse?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
What's wrong with you this time?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before he can hear people cry?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
How many compared to yesterday?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
How's everything in heaven?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Am I ready?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Are you ready?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before they're forever banned?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Like a rolling stone?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Before they're allowed to be free?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Poor boy, where you been?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Are you the same person that was here before?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Silvio, silver and gold
You used––be so proud
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
I've been walking around
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Things would be different the next time we wed
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
He wagged his tail and shook his head
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
I want you, baby, just to understand
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
And those whom doom and death had spared
They took a clean-cut kid
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Everything stays down where it's wounded
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
I live in another world
Now, whenever I get up and
Now you don't seem so proud
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
It's something you did
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
All the sweethearts you can hold
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Just what you had in mind
I will not go down under the ground
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Maybe someday you will understand
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
To see him obviously framed
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
I still can remember the way that you smiled
And into the path you are hurled
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
She let go of my hand
You used to be so amused
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
By no special friend
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
But now something has changed
While some, on principles baptized
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
The changes I was going through can't even be used
I'll always thank the Lord
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
How many times can a man turn his head
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, a very great man once said
There ain't nothing in this world
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
"Equality". I spoke the word
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
I thought that it was well-understood
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Roving gambler, he was very bored
And your trouble is you know it too good
Somebody seen him hanging around
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
But she ain't gonna find the road
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
We live in a political world
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
And that even the nobles get properly handled
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Nothing was delivered
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
As I stand upon the sand
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Its iron claws attached
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Many times I've often prayed
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Then came the warning that was before the flood
I run right home and I went to bed
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
And things would be different the next time we wed
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
He was a clean-cut kid
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
And then you told me later as I apologized
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
But something has changed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Now you don't act so––so proud
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
So I'll make my stand
For what you sold that's not been received
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Limited in sex they dare
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
If dogs run free, why not we
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And the Negro's name
You into thinking you're the one
Though its shadow's metal badge
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Waiting to find out what price
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
You say you're looking for someone
If dogs run free, then what must be
Up into some paradise
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
But I can't say I sympathize
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
How was I to know you'd be the one
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
There were times when I was so lonesome
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
While them that defend what they cannot see
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
I do declare
To show you something you seen before
What about that millionaire
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To give the special one you seek a chance
You said you'd never compromise
So I remember every face
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
The cause was there before we came
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
I rode with him in a taxi once
What good am I then to others and me
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I'm sure you're the one to blame
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
It's all new to me
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Con you into thinking that you're the one
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
But the dark does die
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
I don't even notice she gone
When the roses fade
It'll be with me unto the grave
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
They say don't come back no more
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Maybe someday you will look back and see
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
"It's only you that he does crave
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
So, I called up the operator of time
If dogs run free, why not me
I am homeless, come and take me
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
You smiling through the fence at me
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Full of hope and desire
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
But I feel nothing for their game
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
She plunged him into well water where
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
What you're gonna say when you get home
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Leaving men wholly, totally free
I been wondering all about me
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Hunger pays a heavy price
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
The crashing waves roll over me
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
You cut to the core
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
You just pick anyone
Among the lovely people living free
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
On the rising curve
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
Well, it's all new to me
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
From all the plans they do pursue
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
You're not free to belong to me
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Taking care of somebody nice
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
I'm ready for to fade
Just what you will say when you get home
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
We see this empty cage now corrode
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Lies that life is black-and-white
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
As he rises to fame
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
With all memory and fate
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
A bed that is never mine
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
When the rain is blowing in your face
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And I would send a message
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And you see why it's so unique to be
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
And never sat once at the head of the table
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Remember me to one who lives there
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Little did I realize
But I can get another one
Mona tried to tell me
All I feel is heat and flame
And suddenly there appeared before me
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
And I ain't complaining none
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
It's getting dark, too dark to see
How many ears must one man have
Should I put them by your gate
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Where I could watch her waltz for free
And plenty time for good romance
The man the authorities came to blame
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
So up she picked her babies three
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Breaking hearts up and down the line
What's probably got you baffled more
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
And I'm just the same as anyone else
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Remember me to the one who lives there
That she's the same one
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
From the start by the rule
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
When I'm all alone
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
I can survive and I can endure
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
So I look like a walking mountain range
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Says it's closing time
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Better stay away from those
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
She knows there's no success like failure
At dawn my lover comes to me
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
You know, it's not even safe no more
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
She been gone
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Should I leave them by your gate
Just pick anyone
Knows there's no success like failure
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
He'll see by his grave
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
She rode by night and came by morning
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
The order is a-rapidly fading
If I was with her too long
It's not a bad way to make a living
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
You left me standing in the doorway crying
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
They're drinking up and walking
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And there's no telling who that it's naming
What am I saying? What am I knowing
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Deceived me into thinking
For your weary toes to be touching
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
But then a whistle will be blowing
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
There's nothing in here moving
I know that you know that I know that you show something
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
The order is rapidly fading
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
'Cause the battle outside raging
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Beyond here lies nothing
And the cards are no good that you're holding
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Where the time and the tempo drag
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
The battle outside raging
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
You go north and you go south
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Then she told us how times were tough
And how I know I'll make it through
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Look out, the saints are coming through
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I have fallen far beneath
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
You turn around to take a final peek
Make everything from toy guns that spark
But they caught him and they brought him back
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Shoot in the back
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Her voice once and talk
I wish she'd unlock
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
The man in me will do nearly any task
Well, there ain't no going back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
I chased me a woman up the hill
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
A-how does it feel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
They ask me how I feel
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
He's sure got a lot of gall
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
He's taught in his school
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
How many seas must the white dove sail
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
All and all can only fall
Muttering small talk at the wall
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
How many seas must a white dove sail
How does it feel
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
And if my love is real
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Then why don't she tell
Well, if I die on top of the hill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Ring bar, hard to tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Oh, how does it feel
As the last fire-truck from hell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
A girl by the whirlpool
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Two eyes took the aim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Now, they asked me to read a poem
You better not chew gum
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
But I can hear another drum
"For you cannot relive them
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
And remain as I am
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
My love, she's like some raven
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
But it's hard to think on
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
But I swear I see my reflection
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Will not be understood as they're spoken
And there's no exit in any direction
And all their daughters put me down
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
I'll be waiting at the station
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Out of the shower comes a football man
She takes just like a woman
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
That long, black train is pulling on down
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
I figure maybe we're even
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
You don't need a weatherman
And you ache a-just like a woman
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Their religion of the little ten women
And the corner sign
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
The ones that jump on the wagon
Darkness at the break of noon
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Somebody new to beat on
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Advertising signs that con
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Have died in battle or in vain
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
How can the life of such a man
"Not me," said the gambling man
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
How many roads must a man walk down
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Well, I'm hanging on
You take just like a woman
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
In ceremonies of the horsemen
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
That long, black train is pulling down
And she wakes just like a woman
She got such a sweet disposition
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
All lay down their bandanas and complain
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Well, you fake just like a woman
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
There was little to say, there was no conversation
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
To my knowledge there's just one man
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
For the loser now will be later to win
From heights that they could not gain
Uncle Rat went running downtown
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
But the second mother was with the seventh son
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
But me, I expected it to happen
She said that all the railroad men
But all their daughters put me down
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
And she aches just like a woman
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
A-she takes just like a woman
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Suicide remarks are torn
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Trying to get a lead on
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
He got that fortress on the mountain
Yes, and someone must explain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
As you sit on the box you keep him in
In the pigpen
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
But the post office has been stolen
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
The next morning she had awoken
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
For the loser now might be later to win
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
Must meet the dawn
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Nothing we can call our own
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
All their daughters put me down
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
You need something to make it known
Guns and clubs followed him down
Why did you trade heaven
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
To remember the times when I was your only man
Every place I wanna go
All I'd like you to do
There is a place you go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
There's nothing you can say or do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
All I really wanna do
Silvio, I gotta go
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
How many times must a man look up
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Aladdin and his lamp
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
I walked down there and ended up
The man in the coon-skin cap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
What good am I while you softly weep
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Man in the coon-skin cap
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
My ship is in the harbor
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
For all eternity I think I will remember
I close my eyes and I wonder
Still I've always kind of missed her
Never no more do I wonder
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
At any moment you could go under
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
You heard me saying a prayer for
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
Still I say her love-words over
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
I don't have to go far
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
All you boys better run for cover
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
When you whispered in my ear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
But morning is clear
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
So, don't fear if you hear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
And I don't even think about her
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
In one I was running and in another
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Alone you stand with nobody near
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
For I am married to a house carpenter
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
I could feel a whole lot better
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
The wind howls like a hammer
When only you are near
The face of God will appear
The lover who has just walked out your door
Who came here from Cuba's door
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
I say, "Why you say that for
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Well, the ragman draws circles
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Glide across the lonely years
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
And inside it with the people made of molasses
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I let it slip gladly to my friends
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
The cowboy angel rides
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
And your father, to your sister he explains
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
At times I think there are no words
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
You know that he has no intentions
They whisper in the wings
To the cutting of fences
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Seven days
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Her window's wide open, African trees
What good am I if I say foolish things
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
As friends and other strangers
He's not selling any alibis
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Mama, you know, awaits the news
With a big bouquet of the roses
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
That it's you and no one else that owns
Don't wear sandals
Wants eleven dollar bills
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Thinking of a series of dreams
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Now, you must provide some answers
People carry roses
We living in times when men commit crimes
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
To memorizing politics
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Statues made of matchsticks
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Romantic facts of musketeers
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
But still remains
Six-time users
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Don't follow leaders
People on the platforms
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And the poor white remains
On the back of the fish truck that loads
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
You never turned around to see the frowns
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
And so Patty calls the cops
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
And the princess and the prince discuss
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Girl by the whirlpool's
True love can make a blade of grass
And then complains
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Good and bad, I define these terms
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
You can fall down on your knees
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
I'm gonna let you pass
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
You should be made to wear earphones
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
And, though the masters make the rules
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
How many deaths will it take till he knows
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
But, though the masters make the rules
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
I'd gladly confess
And tells me of her dreams
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
I try to tell it like it is
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
And I try to harmonize with songs
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Six-time losers
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I was thinking of a series of dreams
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
You been hurt so many times
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And without further notice asks you how it feels
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
When your mother sends back all your invitations
To sharpen the senses
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Ain't it hard when you discover that
You used to laugh about
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
But, then again, there's only one I've met
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Johnny's in the basement
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
How many years can a mountain exist
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
The slowest now will later be fast
One more night I will wait for the light
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Yet you know there is no answer fit
That might be all that you got
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
I soon get some rest
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
One more night the moon is shining bright
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
I'm moving after midnight
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Everything is always right
They tell me to be discreet
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
To hold each other tight
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Everyone still talks about
So he never thinks straight
I got into the driver's seat
Well, I finally started thinking straight
By the way, that's a cute hat
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Without any doubt
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
She seems too far out
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
We can hold up a toast if we meet
With your pockets well protected at last
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
I'm on the pavement
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
It don't take too long to find out
Wait for the morning light
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
How many years can some people exist
Someday, everything is gonna be different
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
You're hearing my heart beat
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
Talking that the heat put
The slow one now will later be fast
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
They tell me revenge is sweet
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Plants in the bed, but
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
He built a fire on Main Street
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Oh, everybody's got to eat
You're gonna get hit
You are there in the flickering light
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
To keep it in your mind and not forget
And I, in my armor, turning about
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
There's some people that
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
And the first one now will later be last
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Keep me set apart
I think that it's best
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
In the precious winds they rot
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Keep it in your mind and not forget
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And, since my feet are now fast
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
You used to laugh–make fun about
You don't forget
But, if the arrow is straight
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
In the stillness of the midnight
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
He really wasn't where it's at
Well, early in the morning till late at night
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
I can be just like you
To be alone with you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To protect you and defend you
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'd sure like to know
Don't it always go to show
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
Don't it always a-go to show
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
The only one I know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Yes, I'd sure like to know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
But sooner or later one of us must know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
It only goes to show
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Well, I'd sure like to know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Sooner or later one of us must know
Down every street there's a window
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
He been living there three years now
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
She knocked upon it anyway
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
She puts it to me plain as day
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
She smiles, walks the other way
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
I send you all my money
She starts to speak, but he walks away
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Though I'd never say
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
So I run down most hurriedly
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
So, I'm walking down your highway
And the only tune my guitar could play
Spouted out that liberty
The same thing I would want today
Or if you just want some company
But you can never steal away
And it's up to you to say
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
We banged the drum slowly
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
No, you'll not now or no other day
And for His love they took His life away
From phony jealousy
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
The Spanish-American War had its day
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
For them that think death––death's honesty
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
For them that must obey authority
But I wish there was something you would do or say
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Maggie says that many say
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
But I can't deny
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Is worth more than I could pay
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
I did not do it harmfully
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
For them that think death's honesty
My ears hear a symphony
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Went to the doctor the very next day
To those condemned to act accordingly
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
My mind weaves a symphony
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
So they took him to the infirmary
Don't you tell Henry
Someone to get you flowers constantly
If I don't take the chance to try
That I was just a puppet in a play
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
That I done it the way
And the ladies treat me kindly
Well, I saw it advertised one day
And that which you've given me today
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
A cock is crowing far away
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
To know where you are –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Whispering your secret emotion –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
I long to hold you in the night –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Ha–va–
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
You will not hear a laugh –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Haven't seen her since that night –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Oh, my–
First degree and second degree –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
It can't be this way everywhere –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Havanagee–luh–
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Havana–gee–
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
How badly they were shocked –
Indians camp along her border –
I got no idea what I want –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
With no other choice except but for to go –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Hava–na–
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
I hope that you can hear––
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
With notions his canoe was laden –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Hang out the whole next day –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Leave all the children home –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
I a-hope you can hear––
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Disconnect these cables––
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
I'm sure it was not three –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Private reasons – great or small –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
That can win what's a-never been won –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
