She's insane!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Oh, no!
Dance!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Yeah, man!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Take me down to California, baby!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
Woo!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
He punched me out!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
They was all over!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
I got the freight train blues!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Them Reds did it!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Hootenanny television!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Yes, come out your window!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I'm in love with you!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
I've got the freight train blues!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Alright, now!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
So long, New York!
Thank you!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
My God, they killed Him!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Alright!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
I ain't different than anyone!
Yippee!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Oh!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Goodnight!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Woo-hoo!
Dignity never been photographed!
It was the mailman!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Howdy, East Orange!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I've got a million friends!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
They got away!
Good God!
Well!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
Lordy, Lord!
I wanna be yours!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Start over!
You must think I'm crazy!
How they ever flood my soul!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Betty Ross!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Play that guitar now!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Hope I don't find out too much!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
I figured they was in my TV set!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
You can't blame us at all."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"That way down Highway 61."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
I'll bring back my lady."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You and I'll never know."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "Now!"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
From across that lonesome ocean."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
And have it on Highway 61."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
And keep him good company."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
But I know what you want."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
I'll see her soon, I know."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
So write to her tenderly."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
You must know about my debutante."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
We want folksingers here."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Come flowing down so free?"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Tangled up in blue."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
And punched my cigarette."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
You can't blame me at all."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
And you say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Country'll grow."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Will mourn for your return."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
But we were tangled up in blue."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
I didn't see you around."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
We'll both go home together."
Have it on Highway 61."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Get on your horse and ride away."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
That you must always first forgive them."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
I love far better than thee."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
And pretend that you never have met."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
We'll both go off together."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Is it easy to forget?"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I can't find my knees."
And hung on a willow tree."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
I'll apply them all to thee."
For that reason I will have to stay."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
God said, "On Highway 61."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
They look as dark as night."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
You say, "What's mine?", someone else says, "Where what is?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
They look as white as snow."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
It's all for the love of thee."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
I'll endow them onto thee."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
And says, "Here's your throat back, thanks for the loan."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Has kindly assisted me home."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Would kill a little bird like me."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Where you and I will unite."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
I would want again tomorrow."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
God don't call it wrong,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
I threw it all away,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
People talk over situations,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Advertising signs, they con,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
But you're doing it again,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Icicles hanging down,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Circled by the circus sands,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Get born, keep warm,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
That must be what it's all about,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
A hand set the spark,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Beating for the dead that rise,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Of this I can't say very much,
To protect his white skin,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Ain't no going back,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Just like I did before,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
I got a wife and five little children,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
To know how much I really care,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Stone you just like they said they would,
And come every time you call,
I never can go because, you know,
That the laws are with him,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
And pretend that we never have touched,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
And you know I could never be your own,
We've killed each one,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Oh, watered-down love,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
And it ain't me, babe,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Go down to the river, babe,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Well, I'm so glad,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Well, well, well,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
While paupers change possessions,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Father of minutes, father of days,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Just don't know what to do,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Ooh, watered-down love,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
That can do what's never been done,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Can't find what I need,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Analyze you, categorize you,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Don't wanna be a bum,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Come all without, come all within,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
A man with a badge skips by,
Not the end, not the end,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
I just don't know what to do,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
And ride a horse along the trail,
If'n you don't know by now,
Look away, you rolling river,
I had no one for to go my bail,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Try to be a success,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Looking for a new fool,
By rivers of blindness,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Don't let her hear,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
This world is ruled by violence,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Of ancient history,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
But you try with your whole soul,
If your time to you is worth saving,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
So glad,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
And I'm just like that bird,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
You even make love just like a woman,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Simplify you, classify you,
Joey, Joey,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
People talk of situations,
Yet every distance is not near,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
"Come along and take a trip,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Who could they get to carry you,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
China doll, alcohol,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Over the hills and far away,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Corrina, Corrina,
Rabbit running down across the road,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
All the silver, all the gold,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
You got something I want plenty of,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
In the turning of twilight,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
If you throw it all away,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
A dream about you, baby,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
To your tambourine in time,
God knows it's terrifying,
If anything is gonna sell,
To be on your own,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
For her to arrive,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I had a dream about you, baby,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
I have no one to meet,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
Yesterday is just a memory,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
You got something better,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Or select you or dissect you,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
And may you stay forever young,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
To be without a home,
I'm leaving today,
Tell me that you love me only,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
You always responded when I needed your help,
When I was in Missouri,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
I don't wanna fake you out,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Equality, liberty,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
That can do what's a-never been done,
He been around the world and back again,
I got those worried blues,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Make you spin or do you in,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
A handle hid out in the dark,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Whether you are right or wrong,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
God knows it's true,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
The beat is pumping,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And think they're fooling you,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
People going down to the ground,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Going home,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Stone you when you are young and able,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Go melt back in the night,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
If you must cling to someone,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
I think we better talk this over,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
It's rising up above my head,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Thank You, Lord,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Says he's got a bad bill,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
I've been saved – well, alright,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Don't follow leaders,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
You can run down to the desert,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
I went back home, put on my tie,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
He won't do nothing to you,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
And she'll be coming forth,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
By users, cheaters,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Just like a rolling stone,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
It could even be like a myth,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Without a dream in my heart,
Father of air and father of trees,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
The joint is jumping,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
And it still ain't me, babe,
We'll go out and see it sometime. We'll both just sit there and stare,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Precious father, loving mother,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Dream about you, baby,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Carry the New York Times,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
And I––I walk out on my own,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
No, nothing was delivered,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Want you,
Over your senses you have no control,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
The haunted, frightened trees,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
God knows there's a river,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
But, deep inside my heart,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Never weak, but always strong,
In his anger and his shame,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
This situation can only get rougher,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Father of black, father of white,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Forever young, forever young,
Drifting too far from shore,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Eh, see what you can do,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
She leave by the other and roam,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
I want you,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
In one the surface was frozen,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
In the lonely night,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And to come every time you call,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
"Not I," said the referee,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
They say every distance is not near,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Ah, get sick, get well,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Thinking about the government,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Three angels up above the street,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
I got the worried blues,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
You stole her love from me one day,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
And it's only that I'm asking,
You better duck down the alleyway,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Each one playing a horn,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And I got those worried blues,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
But, if I will save you the time,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
I should have left this town this morning,
You married young just like your ma,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Automobile coming into style,
And it's like I ain't here,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Got me a secret membership card,
Strike another match, go start anew,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
And I don't want to drag you down,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
My senses have been stripped,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
See you fly or watch you die,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Don't mind the driving rain,
It all seemed so well-timed,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
On this new morning, new morning,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
The phone's tapped anyway,
You need something to open your eyes,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Heart of mine,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
And the point is slick,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Don't let yourself fall,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
To shine in through,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Got my mind made up,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
If you'd see me this a-way,
It's alright,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
If not for you,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
She'll surely turn to white,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
You have given everything to me,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
It's too bad he had to go,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Silvio, I gotta go,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
May you stay forever young,
That long, black train is pulling down,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Look who's back in town,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
They––they show me to the door,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
But, to remain as friends,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
So I got those worries blues,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
There's always someone who understands,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
God knows everything,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Front door shut, back door too,
The sky too is folding over you,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Far away from it all,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
It's not aimed at anyone,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Need a woman all the time,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Eh, singing just for you,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
For the wise men and the fools,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Don't you tell Henry,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Is it really any wonder,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Fare thee well but for a while,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
And point away from the past,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Mixing up the medicine,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
In love and with kindness,
God knows it's a crime,
I try my best to be just like I am,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Every moon is so sanctified,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
That fellow who never blushes,
Keep me where you are,
And on the highway of regret,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Too noble to neglect,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Without a love of my own,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
God knows it's outta sight,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
Under the microscope,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
The one we can see and can feel,
Well, I been gambling so long,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Watch the plain-clothes,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
I'm never, never far from home,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I wish I a-was a magician,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
I been good,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Face full of black soot,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
We'll go someplace unknown,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
May be living in another country under another name,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
In the hills of mystery,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
I can change, I swear,
With no direction home,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
And to come each time you call,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
You got to serve somebody,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Heart of mine, go back home,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
I got my mind made up,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
That you'd have liked me to,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Wasn't making any great connection,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
It's really something,
But the time ain't tall,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
She said she would always stay,
My arms and legs were broken,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
And forget my pride,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Light yourself a candle,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Day you quit me, baby,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Stay away from the train line,
Far away in the stormy night,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
You'll change your last name, too,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Seven days,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Nothing was delivered,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
To hang and to lynch,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
They say every man must need protection,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Yes, and I'll go last,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
When there is no more,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
New morning,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Something about you that I can't shake,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Now you don't talk so loud,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
You had enough of hatred,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
May be an actor in a plot,
And furnish me with tape,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
God don't call it treason,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
That her father was going to hang,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Made before the foundation of the world,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
In the foggy web of destiny,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Too serious to fool,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Precious angel under the sun,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
The man in the trench-coat,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Love that's pure no accident,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I run right home and I went to bed,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
And ye shall be a-changed,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
You gotta look some other place,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
God knows it's a struggle,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Don't matter what you did,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
And you make love just like a woman,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Tell me,
Is looking for a new fool,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
When the night comes falling,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
She once was a true love of mine,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
I can't be good, baby,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Speaking to some French girl,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
If she ain't feeling well,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
The winter would hold no spring,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Oh, you gone to the finest school – alright, Ms. Lonely,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
It was from her ship sailing,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
God knows when,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Give you my money, honey,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I went into the red, went into the black,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
They say that every man must fall,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Without ideals or violence,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I wish tonight were here,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
And gathering storms may arise,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
And I'm in the shade,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Now, won't you tell me true,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
The air is getting hotter,
She's opened up a happy home,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Ten thousand men on the move,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
And your streets are getting empty,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
I thank the Lord,
My dear, sweet friend,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
And not going through any great extreme,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Well, the way I love that woman,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Bring the wife and family,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
For his age he is wise,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Said I'm pressing on,
Father of loneliness and pain,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
You want watered-down love,
I'd already gone the distance,
I bless the day I found you,
To keep up his hate,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
And she makes love just like a woman,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Staying far behind without you,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
It hurts me, too,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Going, going, gone,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
He's not selling any alibis,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Oh, see what you can do,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
And here I sit so patiently,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
But I've been hanging on,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
And also by his feet,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
With his candle lit into the sun,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I'm going out of my mind,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I got two white horses following me,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
In the image of someone you used to know,
You'll be doing society a favor,
We take great delight in our own company,
Paradise, sacrifice,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Every head is so dignified,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
You have given me eyes to see,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Baby, let me follow you down,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
I can make it through,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
You could look at it and weep,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Broken switches, broken gates,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
I ain't looking to block you up,
He got that soft, silky skin,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
My limbs are shaking,
Don't let her know,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Private reasons, great or small,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
It always has hit me from below,
Pressing on,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Stone you and say good luck,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Went back home to the yard,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Human gods aim for their mark,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
I went into the city, into the town,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I went out last night to take a little round,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
People carry roses,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Don't let me change my heart,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
I won't have my nature way,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
The wind blowing the snow around,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Made of silver or of golden,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
To gather flowers constantly,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
And you take just like a woman,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
With his fist in a clinch,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
I get my sweet reward,
I've been around this whole country,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
But the bottles are done,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
But he can't be blamed,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Baby, please stop crying,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
The man there said he loved my sound,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
I'll be on my way,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
You were striped, you were plain,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
They say every man need protection,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
How many times have you heard someone say,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
And, if I see the day,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
But I'm pressing on,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
I just keep pressing on,
The day you quit me, baby,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
They must bust in early May,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
She never does me wrong,
And, although that we're single and free,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Take the motherless children off the street,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
But you were gambling for support,
One by one they follow the sun,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
When I seen him lose control,
To be alone with you,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
Never needed to call you my whore,
The country music station plays soft,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
But, if I can save you any time,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Watch the river flow,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Hang around the ink-well,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
To stay closer than any friend,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Puffing on a big cigar,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
I would not feel so all alone,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Ever since I been a child,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Stripping away at it all,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
God knows you ain't pretty,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
If ever I prove false to you,
To find out if she's talked,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
A complete unknown,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Tears on the letter that I write,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Who will promise never to part,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Strangers all give me the news,
I'm going down the river,
I found my world, found my world in you,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
A true love of mine,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
All I really wanna do,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
And, if anybody asks me,
Oh, Angelina,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
In the little church a-this side of town,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
The country doctor rambles,
I know I can't win,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Don't wear sandals,
I don't care if you feel like me,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
I can see the turning of the key,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Mercury, gravity,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
So unknown,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Father of day, father of night,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
I'd only have to stay,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
You and me, we had completeness,
Silhouetted by the sea,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Carved next to his name,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Going, going,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Newspapermen eating candy,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
That foreign sound in your ear,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Six months on the chain gang,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Searching everywhere I know,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
A million faces at my feet,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
One by one they followed the sun,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
That fired the gun,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
I went into the city, went into the town,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
That they do not respect in any degree,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
But it ain't me, babe,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
To have––be on your own,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
With the juice running down my leg,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Don't let her see that you need her,
You made it there somehow,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
All you can do is do what you must,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Two by two they step in the dark,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Someone to open each and every door,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
My hands can't feel to grip,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
I just don't see why I should even care,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
I want my arms around you,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Each time we meet, love,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
And, if I can save you any time,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
I've been all around the world, boys,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Without your sweet love,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Serve somebody,
You're beautiful to me,
You have explained every mystery,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
You need something to open up a new door,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Like a complete unknown,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
It still ain't me, babe,
Memory, ecstasy,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
King of the streets, child of clay,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Where I will always be renewed,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
God knows there's a heaven,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
In the great unknown,
It was you who came right through,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Seem like I been down this way before,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
And all of your children start to resent you,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Like a rolling stone,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Out to the windy beach,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Keep a clean nose,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Why she did go,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
True love, they've been without it,
She got great big hind legs,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Courage is a thing of the past,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
I'm pledging my time to you,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Had no one to go my bail,
And I'm so glad,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
I shall be released,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Is used, it is plain,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Now, lamp-gates and <i>[incomprehensible]</i>, I can recite 'em all,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Someone to close his heart,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
One by one until there were none,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And the whole world is on your case,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
As the present now will later be past,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Yes, I want you so bad,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
It don't matter what you did,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
I rambled out of New York town,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Aim well, my little one,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
You will be alright, girl,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Watching the river flow,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Oh, singing just for you,
They say everything can be replaced,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
You don't want a love that's pure,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Try hard, get barred,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
From their fates try to resign,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Look out, kid,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
On the stone that remains,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
The kingdoms of experience,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
To be so useless and all,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Tell her not to worry,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You can raise up your right hand,
I got a bird that whistles,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Far past the frozen leaves,
In a pine box for all eternity,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Far away and over the wall,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
He's the property of Jesus,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Like as not, it's better so,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Who among them would try to impress you,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
She'll be coming forth,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
You don't have to feed me,
We'll fly the night away,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
I can't understand,
My love, she speaks softly,
And there's two white horses following me,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Better jump down the manhole,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
So, never leave me lonely,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
You have laid down Your life for me,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I fell down to my bended knees,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Like a dog on a chain,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Heart of mine, be still,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
You have given all there is to give,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
I got no place left to turn,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
She would have married me,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I'd be sad and blue,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Where life and death are memorized,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
And she aches just like a woman,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Come on, come on, stick together,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Gonna serve somebody,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
I just can't do what I've done before,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
It's like I ain't here,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
You're beautiful beyond words,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
He's young and on fire,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
True love of mine,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Saved,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
First degree and second degree,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I try my best to be like I am,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Where mercy walks the plank,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
All the tired horses in the sun,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Friends with you,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Nothing too very scientific,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Get dressed, get blessed,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
God knows you've got to weep,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
I been good while I been waiting,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
But ye shall be a-changed,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
And give him back the time he's done,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
You to me were true,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
More people kept a-piling on,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Stand up straight and tall,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Holding his club like he was a king,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
God knows there's a chance,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Winter would have no spring,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
They say every man must fall,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
If I didn't have to guess,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
But, if you want me to,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
How many a year has passed and gone,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Or have done something wrong,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
I long to see you in the morning light,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Badge out, laid off,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Don't tie no bows,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
But I would not feel so all alone,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
In the darkness of my night,
You wanna drown love,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
If you'd see me this way,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Alright, I'm so glad,
And I got the worried blues,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
When she lays upon the grass,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Loyalty, unity,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Broken hands on broken plows,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
For all intended purposes,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
You have given me life to live,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Like you never did before,
Don't try No Doz,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
I swung on to my old guitar,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Most of the time it's well understood,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
He is centuries old,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
As his youth now unfolds,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
And, though the line is cut,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Relationships of ownership,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Just then the order came to charge,
The sky too is folding under you,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
I had so much left to do,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
Grandpa died last week,
But now morning is clear,
That two healers cannot heal him,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
The wind howls like a hammer,
My love, she speaks like silence,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
While riding on a train going west,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Till both of us fell by the way,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
But something has changed,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
I once held her in my arms,
And I'm back in the rain,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
With a killer's pride, security,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
The carpet too is moving under you,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Hmm, see what you can do,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Searching high, searching low,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Trouble,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Since you've been gone,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Oh, in somebody's room,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
With what your fate is going to be,
They tell me every man must fall,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
I like the cool way you look at me,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Watered-down love,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
In the end,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
How he died nobody can say,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
How he died nobody could say,
And I know what you're thinking of,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
To be––direction home,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Don't steal, don't lift,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
I want you so bad,
You were snow, you were rain,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Don't let me drift too far,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
God knows there's a purpose,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
But I know that he don't talk,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
By losers, cheaters,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
How does it feel,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Just remember that death is not the end,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Madams light the candles,
To a solid rock,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
The night passed away so quickly,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Well, come all without, come all within,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Trust yourself,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
I need a shot of love,
The Second World War came to an end,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
At the close of the day,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Get back, write Braille,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Vanished from my hand,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Love don't have any place,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Wintertime in New York town,
The light I never knowed,
But I'm saved,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
It always means so much,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
I can finish this alone, honey,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
The night would see me wide awake,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Precious memories, how they linger,
It's a price I have to pay,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Don't let her see where you're going,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
When all will be well,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
God knows it's fragile,
Pick you up every time you fall,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
I went down to scrub and rub,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
For the politician's gain,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
They lowered him down as a king,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
The day would surely have to break,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
God knows that, when you see it,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Well, I may just swear,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Looking 'bout the government,
But I will be back, I will survive,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Using every angle under the sun,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
All them prophets good and gone,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
To be out on your own,
Thieving in the alley,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Go away from my window,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
First to come in was the flying moth,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
But it ain't him to blame,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
Every brain is civilized,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
You've got to serve somebody,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I been riding the midnight train,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
In the instant that I preach,
They keep it all hid,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
But evidently she don't,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Father of night, father of day,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
A thousand miles from home,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Well, get sick, get well,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Laying low,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
She's the worst you could ever have,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
I'd give you the sky high above,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
God knows how to make it flow,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
I'm so glad,
Waiting for the trains,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
You better chew gum,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
But it would not be new,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
"Not me," said his manager,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Going,
To strict party-platform ties,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Like some mystery,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
But he's the property of Jesus,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
We live in a political world,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Up and down the block,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
The only son of God Almighty,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
In the ruins of your balcony,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
She said she would never forget,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
They say every man needs protection,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Name of Martin Luther King,
For she ain't the same,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
And played the fife lowly,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
God sees it all unfold,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
I just say no thanks,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
My woman needs it every day,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Bringing me all of your charms,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Never did feel this way before,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Every nerve is analyzed,
For something that he never done,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Resent him to the bone,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Just to know that you are near,
There she come, now, down my way,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Ye shall be changed,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Don't let her see,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
Roll, Willie, roll,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Want you so bad,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Better jump down a manhole,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Honey, I will meet you there,
They don't believe in mercy,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Says he's got a bad cough,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Don't ever try to change me,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Democracy don't rule the world --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
That's where you belong --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
To be alone with you.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
And the Santa Fe.
Drifting too far from shore.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Everything is gonna be alright.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
In fond memory appear.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Blues wrapped around my head.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
I know you always say that you agree.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Memories of what used to be.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I want you.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
At not getting their money's worth.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Chain you down or bring you down.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
To hold me in your arms.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
Hope that it don't sleet.
They would not let me be.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Some speak of the future.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
When my memory is not so short.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
She murdered mortal he.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
You don't want me, give my money back.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Turned on my record player.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
You're too hot, darling.
That last night I was with.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
But simply because it's true.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
But you're back where you belong.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Oh, yes, they did.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
I can't fire them anymore.
To live it you had to explode.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
See him at play makes me smile.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
The next day could be your last.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Got my mind made up.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
About an old man that never done wrong.
Kisses she gave him three.
Just crying out that he was framed.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Looking for a new friend.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
That's the way I remember her best.
I stood wondering which way to go.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Leave no stone unturned.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Is just equality in school.
From my toes up to my ears.
Oh, Angelina.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
I'll remember you.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
And ye shall be changed.
And get something quick to eat.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Havanageeluh.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
Got ice water in my veins.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
To see that you're madly in love.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
And rivers that ran through every day.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
I did not do it knowingly.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Precious memories flood my soul.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Someone who will die for you and more.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Hoping you'll come through too.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
Baby, please come home.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Mine alone.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Everybody that was hanging out.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Hear me singing through these tears.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
To see what kinda words he could say.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
The last radio is playing.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
In the pale moonlight.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
The hour that the ship comes in.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
The country doctor rambles.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
All of your <i>[incomprehensible]</i> and let's talk about your soul.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
That can win what's never been won.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
I just can't see through it anymore.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Greenwich Village.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Come on, baby.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
When you go your way and I go mine.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
I always thought that he was well.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Leading me, going home.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
I got nothing to go back to now.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
The words that her lover had said.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
You give something up for everything you gain.
But I would never do you wrong.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Mama, you are on my mind.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
I once held her in my arms.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Going through all these things twice.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
He never did know what it was all about.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
To anything I might have tried.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
My baby stole my heart from me.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
The time and the place that we'd part.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You got a heart of stone.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Just you and me.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Everything inside is made of stone.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
To the sin of love's false security.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
Lost time is not found again.
Fear to bring children into the world.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Watch the parking meters.
Adiós, mi corazón.
With the glory that is to be.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
The sooner you can leave.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Until my dying-day.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
I just can't beg you anymore.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
We may not make it through the night.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
I've seen trouble all my days.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
And all I see are dark eyes.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
New morning.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
And you only got ten.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
Everything was exactly the way that it seems.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
If I ride back again.
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine.
Rain would gather, too.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
See that my grave is kept clean.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Step lightly on the ground.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Crying out that he was framed.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
In the night the price was paid.
Everything is gonna be fine.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
After losing every battle.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
And I'll rock you too.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Never been so easy or so slow.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
It's that million dollar bash.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
Know not what the years may hold.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
You break your promise all over the place.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
But I know that I can't move.
Under the hedges.
But that's what I am paid to do.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
You cast your spell and I went under.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
Remember, before you come, at least please first telephone.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
But she had some way of finding them out.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
With an iron chain around his neck.
He's only a pawn in their game.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
The National Guard stands around the door.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
They both rode off together.
68, but says he's 24.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Well, I'm just thumping.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Six by six...
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
Friends with you.
I don't even know why we come.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
On the caboose of the train.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Honey, baby.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Figuring a way to get back home.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Dollar a day's worth.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
His voice was low with pain.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Valentines can't buy her.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
68, but says she's 24.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
You won't get it for money.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
Last radio is playing.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
You're gonna need my help someday.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
You're on the bottom.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
People bending broken rules.
That Johanna's not here.
Buildings going up to the sky.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
While evening slips away.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
I hate bears.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Is gonna be against the law.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
And laid his life on the line.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
Until I threw it all away.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Everything is broken.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
And tapestry of rhyme.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I'd be lost if not for you.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
I'll only let you down.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
To anything I mighta tried.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
I will only let you down.
By that soft and shining sea.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
So the radio didn't work so well.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
To reach of your rattling drums.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Even the softest touch.
Life don't mean a thing.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
I got a bird that sings.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
My mind is breaking.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
It was a normal day.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Feel further away than ever before.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
It don't matter anyhow.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Nobody stops to ask why.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Go lightly on the ground.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
It hurts me, too.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Lay dead beside him there.
Headed out for the western skies.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
You're my baby.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Good car to drive, after a war.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Rode slowly back again.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Epitome, rigidity.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
I'm not the one you need.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Hmm, tell me.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
I know something is changed.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Hope you're ready.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
That's the day you die.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
And he was a friend of mine.
I finally got a job in New York town.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
She acts like we never met.
Like you never done before.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
I see better days and I do better things.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Need that woman straight and true.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
I couldn't find any.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
Girls like birds fly away.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
No kindred or relative nigh.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
When I paint my masterpiece.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Trying to create a next world war.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
She once was a true love of mine.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Thought I was a communist.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Chain you down or be your clown.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
While I'm in the hall.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
There's a guy I gotta see.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
And time is beginning to crawl.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
At the sorority sisters' home.
That big, old boat started to sink.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Using ideas as my maps.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
It's just the same as talking to you.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
I shall be released.
Wasn't any difference to me.
I had so little time to fail.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
But I was raised on the other.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
You're a big girl all the way.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
That which is not permanent don't last.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
I would only let you down.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
And light on your right knee.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
If you won't come out your window.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
I just can't do what I done before.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
His enemies say he's on their land.
And guarded them as they fell.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
The National Guard stands around his door.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Said it was a bad dream.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Tried to create a next world war.
Funny way to start a picnic.
I took some comfort there.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign.
Because everybody must get stoned.
And the night blows rainy.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
Go find out something only dead men know.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
There's no words that need to be said.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Just to take somebody's money away.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
Up and down the lonesome town.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
And the people that confronted him were many.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
"And light on my right knee.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
I long to reach for you in the night.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Come on, baby...
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
And each one I've never seen again.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
I froze right to the bone.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
I been worrying about you, baby.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
I never saw the man again.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Right now I'm having trouble.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
And I want you to be that woman.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
And it never seemed strange.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
But these to tell what's true.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
In the brightness of my day.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
With my suitcase in my hand.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Come on, darling.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Baby, let me follow you down.
And all your raging glory.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
Means another poor boy is underground.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
And your golden loom.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
And try to avoid the scandals.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
But you're never sure why you're here.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
The night will soon be gone.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Can't see over to the other side.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Calling out that he's been framed.
But with the country to where you're going.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Come on, honey.
To kill with no pain.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
She pretends like we never have met.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
As if a wedding vow.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Bid farewell forever.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.

Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
"Don't trill no news on me.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.

When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.

Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
All because his face was brown.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
You are on the bottom.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Without ideals or violence.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
She said she would always stay.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Good as I been to you.
Baby, baby.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.

Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
The whole night through.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Fighting every inch of the way.
I threw it all away.
What's real and what is not.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
With the golden loom.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
He went down to Oxford Town.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Hmm.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
God knows...
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
What looks like the easy way out.
In the palace of the Pope.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
She just acts like we never have met.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
Crying out that he been framed.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Bring that bottle over here.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Just what this song is all about.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Honey, come and see about me.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Someone's watching over you.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
I see that stationmaster too.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Drink up your blood like wine.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
There was nobody around.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
When he played and we didn't dance.
In my Cadillac.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
I had something to protect.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
And crime don't have a face.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
With your golden loom.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Broken voices on broken phones.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Patriotism, materialism.

Have fallen from her curls.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
Hope I don't blow it.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Join the army if you fail.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Slowly into autumn.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Heart of mine.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
With all these promises you left for me.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
And ye shall be a-changed.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Evidently she won't.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
You got it, baby.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
There were six thousand people there.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Four by four they turn it some more.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I can walk anytime around the block.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
My face you'll never see no more.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
I'm a poet, I know it.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
But you're not even sure what it is.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
That brave and devoted band.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
All my connections too.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
The place that I started from.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
"And stay all night with me.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
He's running for office on the ballot note.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Unless they're from another world.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
But my heart just won't give in.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
You always got more than enough rope.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
And that failure's no success at all.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
I said that.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
It don't matter, anyhow.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Look a-the other way.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Never will want for money.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
And your highway's getting filled.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
It only brings me sorrow.
Her fond face pale with woe.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Duality, mortality.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
He's the neighborhood bully.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
For she once was a true love of mine.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Suffering like a fool.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
And they gotta cut something.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Who says she knows me well.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a, a bone.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Throw my ticket out the window.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
I'm falling in love with you.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
His mama sure was proud of him.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
Living down Sonora way.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
But he sure left here in style.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Going, going, gone.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
From the little Minnesota town.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
I'd give anything to be with you.
I'd like to know.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Crumble into one another.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
But all I see are dark eyes.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
All because of the color of his skin.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Someone I really could care for.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
As the present now will later be past.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
I'll hold it down for you.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
Honey, I want you.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
If you just let me follow you down.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Come over here from over there, girl.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Or inspect you or reject you.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
When my working day's through.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
Tomorrow will be another day.
But the fighter still remains.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Yes, tell me.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
The same as my father before him.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Rain would gather too.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
You were always so close and still within reach.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Where teardrops fall.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
And come away with me.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
'Steada acting like we never met.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Is what this thing here is for.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Madams light the candles.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
See like me or be like me.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
In an oil refinery.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Most of the time.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
He ain't-a got no name.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
To make me think I'm wrong.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
You want a watered-down love.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
Ever since I seen her smile.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
A true love of mine.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
For me to return to or chase.
And without further notice he asks you how it feels.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Ever since we've been apart.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Of every man who put me here.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Looking for the places only they would know.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
And the morning will be breaking.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
And you must realize the danger.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
On this new morning with you.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
But you break just like a little girl.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
They want me for a gambling fight.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
That old ship was a-going down.
And relive my dreams.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Baby, baby...
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
You can make it too.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
And one day he came passing by.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
Or stay all night with thee.
And I need you, ah.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
It can't be this way everywhere.
A-lord, protect my child.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
If not for you.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Orders from the D.A.
And keep away from pranks.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He could die happily ever after.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
I remember her whispering yet.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
But it was more than I could do.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
And wait for succeeding kings.
You're a big girl now.
Mortality, reality.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
You can say I didn't give to you.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Please quit your low-down ways.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
I can't hear you anymore.
Everybody's having them dreams.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
I'm sad and lonely too.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
I don't care what in the world you do.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
My baby told me I would have to go.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
I's looking around just to see myself.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
And gives it to me for a song.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
Find out something only dead men know.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
When you made everybody pay.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
So long, honey babe.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Honey, I never would have come.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Some place so high above this wall.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
It ain't quite the end.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
You may not see me tomorrow.
People sleeping in broken beds.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
That must be what it's all about.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
I can't use it anymore.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
I'll be your baby tonight.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
High society, notoriety.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Behind a man's brain.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
I want everybody to be free.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
You'll do as much for me.
Now and forever let it be me.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Into my own parade.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
I'm going where I never been before.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
And I need you, yeah.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Oh, convey herself away.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
You don't have to be afraid.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
That linger in the fireball heat.
And clouds cover up the ground.
You know the song in my heart.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.

I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.

Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
For that's the way I remember her best.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.

And the mailbox is locked.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.

So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.

They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.

You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.

Just like the time before and the time before that.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
And shot it fulla holes.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.

To which a scoundrel clings.
Down along my restless palms.
And left me here facing the wall.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.

And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
So many people I never saw in my life.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.

Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
I hope you're ready.

Some place so high above the wall.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.

And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
And discovered her invisible self.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
And then unto eternity.
When I run outta things to investigate.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
With gold and silver in her hand.
You don't have to worry any more.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.

And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
When I'm alone with you.
My love winks, she does not bother.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Serve somebody:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
But there's one promise, darling:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
His epitaph plain:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Yeah, serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Till I come into New York town:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Man is opposed to fair play:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Had to be held down by big police;
I find complete love;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
All lies and jest;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine;
Make promises by the hour;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Some speak of the future;
Crumble into one another;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;

After he's taken everything he could steal?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Are you ready?
Just like a rolling stone?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
By golly, what more can I say?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Before you call him a man?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
What can I give to You?
How could they ever mistake you?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
When he's standing in front of you?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Must everybody bow?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
How does it feel?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
How long are we gonna be riding?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
How many paths did they try and fail?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Before they're forever banned?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
But, still, something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just what in the world has come over you?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Before he can hear people cry?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
What good am I?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Across the swooping plain?
Baby, can't you tell?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
How much poison did they inhale?
Like a rolling stone?
Where did you hide your halo?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Am I still dreaming yet?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
What would life be?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
And how does it feel?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
How could they let you go?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Can I come home with you?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Has anybody seen my love?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
That too many people have died?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
But, something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What can I do for You?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Oh, where are you tonight?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
How can you say he will haunt you?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
To love and follow His direction?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
How's everything in heaven?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
How many more can they afford?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
How many compared to yesterday?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
And one deserving of affection?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Before it is washed to the sea?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Gal, where you been so long?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Did you respect me for what I did?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
When did you leave heaven?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Before it's washed to the sea?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Baby, can I come home with you?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Of everything you see?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
For all these earthly things?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Can you get back in?
What else can a poor boy do?
Before he can see the sky?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Too many people have died?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
But who did I see but the one I love?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Why would I want to take your life?
How many more without any reward?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Where did you lose your wings?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Does anyone even try?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Why and what's the reason for?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Who's gonna let it roll?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Across the swamp of time?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Have they missed you?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
How can I live for You?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Am I ready?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
You have to pay to get outta
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
For what you sold that's not been received
I want you, baby, just to understand
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
While some, on principles baptized
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
He wagged his tail and shook his head
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Things would be different the next time we wed
I'll always thank the Lord
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
But all that suffering was not to be compared
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
I run right home and I went to bed
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Just what you had in mind
All the sweethearts you can hold
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Now, whenever I get up and
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
And things would be different the next time we wed
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Now, a very great man once said
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
There ain't nothing in this world
By no special friend
I've been walking around
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Now you don't seem so proud
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
The changes I was going through can't even be used
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
How many times can a man turn his head
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Nothing was delivered
I live in another world
They took a clean-cut kid
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And those whom doom and death had spared
But she ain't gonna find the road
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I had to say something to strike him very weird
As I stand upon the sand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
To see him obviously framed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Somebody seen him hanging around
Many times I've often prayed
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Silvio, silver and gold
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
You used to be so amused
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
So I'll make my stand
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Then came the warning that was before the flood
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
And then you told me later as I apologized
It's something you did
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
I thought that it was well-understood
She let go of my hand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
But now something has changed
And your trouble is you know it too good
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
He was a clean-cut kid
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I will not go down under the ground
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Now you don't act so––so proud
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
We live in a political world
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
You used––be so proud
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
"Equality". I spoke the word
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Standing on the water, casting your bread
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And into the path you are hurled
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Its iron claws attached
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Maybe someday you will understand
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
I still can remember the way that you smiled
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Taking care of somebody nice
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
"It's only you that he does crave
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
You're not free to belong to me
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
Should I leave them by your gate
There were times when I was so lonesome
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Just what you will say when you get home
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Everybody's wearing a disguise
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
While them that defend what they cannot see
What good am I then to others and me
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
I am homeless, come and take me
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
See the primitive wallflower freeze
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Knows there's no success like failure
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Why wait any longer for the one you love
"That I might be gone a long, old time
And plenty time for good romance
So, I called up the operator of time
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
And you see why it's so unique to be
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
And I would send a message
You into thinking you're the one
She plunged him into well water where
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
She knows there's no success like failure
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
I rode with him in a taxi once
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
At dawn my lover comes to me
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
I don't even notice she gone
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
The cause was there before we came
Looking at hands for the lines that were
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
I been wondering all about me
You cut to the core
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
And never sat once at the head of the table
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
When the roses fade
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Lies that life is black-and-white
But I can't say I sympathize
From the start by the rule
Says it's closing time
Mona tried to tell me
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Should I put them by your gate
Full of hope and desire
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Well, six white horses that you did promise
So I look like a walking mountain range
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Waiting to find out what price
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Among the lovely people living free
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
She been gone
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
You said you'd never compromise
Remember me to the one who lives there
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
On the rising curve
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
How was I to know you'd be the one
You say you're looking for someone
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
If dogs run free, then what must be
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
What about that millionaire
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
All I feel is heat and flame
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
From all the plans they do pursue
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Remember me to one who lives there
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
When I'm all alone
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
When the rain is blowing in your face
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Though its shadow's metal badge
It's getting dark, too dark to see
If dogs run free, why not me
Hunger pays a heavy price
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
I do declare
He'll see by his grave
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Just pick anyone
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Up into some paradise
Little did I realize
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Better stay away from those
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
If dogs run free, why not we
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
And the Negro's name
From the Golden Gate Bridge
So I remember every face
As he rises to fame
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
They say don't come back no more
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
To give the special one you seek a chance
The crashing waves roll over me
The man the authorities came to blame
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
How many ears must one man have
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
So up she picked her babies three
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
Con you into thinking that you're the one
I can survive and I can endure
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Leaving men wholly, totally free
We see this empty cage now corrode
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Maybe someday you will look back and see
That she's the same one
It's all new to me
You know, it's not even safe no more
You could almost think that you're seeing double
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And suddenly there appeared before me
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And I ain't complaining none
A bed that is never mine
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
But I can get another one
It'll be with me unto the grave
To show you something you seen before
You just pick anyone
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
But I feel nothing for their game
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Limited in sex they dare
What's probably got you baffled more
But the dark does die
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
Oh, trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
For your weary toes to be a-touching
For your weary toes to be touching
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And there's no telling who that it's naming
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
If I was with her too long
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
The battle outside raging
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
There's nothing in here moving
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
But then a whistle will be blowing
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
They're drinking up and walking
She rode by night and came by morning
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
The order is rapidly fading
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Where the time and the tempo drag
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Early in the morning, early in the morning
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And the cards are no good that you're holding
'Cause the battle outside raging
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
It's not a bad way to make a living
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Deceived me into thinking
The order is a-rapidly fading
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Girls' faces formed the forward path
You go north and you go south
Look out, the saints are coming through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Then she told us how times were tough
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I have fallen far beneath
And how I know I'll make it through
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Her voice once and talk
The man in me will do nearly any task
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark
Well, there ain't no going back
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
Make everything from toy guns that spark
You turn around to take a final peek
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Shoot in the back
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
I wish she'd unlock
But they caught him and they brought him back
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
But among the dead that were left on the hill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
How many seas must the white dove sail
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Oh, how does it feel
And if my love is real
I chased me a woman up the hill
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Muttering small talk at the wall
They ask me how I feel
He's taught in his school
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
All and all can only fall
Well, if I die on top of the hill
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
How does it feel
He's sure got a lot of gall
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Then why don't she tell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
A girl by the whirlpool
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
To make all that should be killed to crawl
A-how does it feel
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Ring bar, hard to tell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
How many seas must a white dove sail
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Ring bell, hard to tell
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
You better not chew gum
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
But I can hear another drum
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
So, one morning when the sun was warm
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And remain as I am
Now, they asked me to read a poem
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Two eyes took the aim
"For you cannot relive them
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
How can the life of such a man
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
And she wakes just like a woman
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
I figure maybe we're even
You need something to make it known
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
Yes, and someone must explain
As they rode him in custody down to the station
The ones that jump on the wagon
Uncle Rat went running downtown
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
For the loser now will be later to win
But the post office has been stolen
Out of the shower comes a football man
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Well, I'm hanging on
But it's hard to think on
Have died in battle or in vain
But I swear I see my reflection
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
But the second mom was with the seventh son
How many roads must a man walk down
Must meet the dawn
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I'll be waiting at the station
Trying to get a lead on
My love, she's like some raven
In ceremonies of the horsemen
He got that fortress on the mountain
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
But the second mother was with the seventh son
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Guns and clubs followed him down
To my knowledge there's just one man
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
"Not me," said the gambling man
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
She takes just like a woman
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
That long, black train is pulling on down
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
From heights that they could not gain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
You take just like a woman
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Well, you fake just like a woman
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Darkness at the break of noon
Advertising signs that con
For the loser now might be later to win
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
She got such a sweet disposition
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
She said that all the railroad men
The next morning she had awoken
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Suicide remarks are torn
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
That long, black train is pulling down
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
And the corner sign
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
And there's no exit in any direction
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Their religion of the little ten women
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
And you ache a-just like a woman
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
There was little to say, there was no conversation
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Why did you trade heaven
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
All their daughters put me down
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
In the pigpen
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Somebody new to beat on
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
A-she takes just like a woman
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
And all their daughters put me down
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
You don't need a weatherman
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
And she aches just like a woman
But all their daughters put me down
To remember the times when I was your only man
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
But me, I expected it to happen
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
The foreign sun, it squints upon
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
All I'd like you to do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
There is a place you go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
The very last thing that I'd want to do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
All I really wanna do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Every place I wanna go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Silvio, I gotta go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
There's nothing you can say or do
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
I walked down there and ended up
What good am I while you softly weep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
How many times must a man look up
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Aladdin and his lamp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Man in the coon-skin cap
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
She took him by his long, yellow hair
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Alone you stand with nobody near
So, don't fear if you hear
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
The lover who has just walked out your door
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I could feel a whole lot better
You heard me saying a prayer for
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
Never no more do I wonder
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
I close my eyes and I wonder
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
The face of God will appear
When only you are near
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Who came here from Cuba's door
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Still I say her love-words over
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
All you boys better run for cover
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
When you whispered in my ear
In one I was running and in another
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
And I don't even think about her
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
For I am married to a house carpenter
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
At any moment you could go under
Still I've always kind of missed her
For all eternity I think I will remember
But morning is clear
I say, "Why you say that for
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
The wind howls like a hammer
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
I don't have to go far
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Six-time losers
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
To the cutting of fences
Wants eleven dollar bills
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
And the princess and the prince discuss
You can fall down on your knees
That it's you and no one else that owns
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
And, though the masters make the rules
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And then complains
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
As friends and other strangers
To memorizing politics
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Romantic facts of musketeers
I was thinking of a series of dreams
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Seven days
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And your father, to your sister he explains
On the back of the fish truck that loads
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
People carry roses
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I'm gonna let you pass
People on the platforms
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
With a big bouquet of the roses
Now, you must provide some answers
But, though the masters make the rules
But still remains
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
The cowboy angel rides
To sharpen the senses
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
"Not me," said the man whose fists
And tells me of her dreams
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
True love can make a blade of grass
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Don't follow leaders
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
You should be made to wear earphones
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
In the dimestores and bus-stations
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
And the poor white remains
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
With a fantastic collection of stamps
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
At times I think there are no words
Don't wear sandals
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
We living in times when men commit crimes
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
Girl by the whirlpool's
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
And I try to harmonize with songs
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
You been hurt so many times
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
They whisper in the wings
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
I try to tell it like it is
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Mama, you know, awaits the news
You never turned around to see the frowns
You know that he has no intentions
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Glide across the lonely years
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
I'd gladly confess
He's not selling any alibis
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Statues made of matchsticks
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Her window's wide open, African trees
And inside it with the people made of molasses
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Thinking of a series of dreams
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Well, the ragman draws circles
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And so Patty calls the cops
Six-time users
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
What good am I if I say foolish things
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Good and bad, I define these terms
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Without any doubt
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Like a corkscrew to my heart
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
But, then again, there's only one I've met
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Well, early in the morning till late at night
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Well, I finally started thinking straight
You are there in the flickering light
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
And the first one now will later be last
With your pockets well protected at last
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
And I, in my armor, turning about
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
You're hearing my heart beat
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Everything is always right
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
She seems too far out
Talking that the heat put
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
You're gonna get hit
And, since my feet are now fast
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
It don't take too long to find out
He really wasn't where it's at
But, if the arrow is straight
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Wait for the morning light
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
To hold each other tight
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Someday, everything is gonna be different
I'm on the pavement
Johnny's in the basement
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
How many years can a mountain exist
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Keep it in your mind and not forget
They tell me revenge is sweet
So he never thinks straight
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
In the precious winds they rot
No one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Plants in the bed, but
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
He built a fire on Main Street
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Yet you know there is no answer fit
You used to laugh–make fun about
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
And no one has any respect – anyway, they just expect
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
By the way, that's a cute hat
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
You used to laugh about
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Every new messenger bringing evil report
No one has any respect – anyway, they expect
How many years can some people exist
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
One more night I will wait for the light
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
I think that it's best
They tell me to be discreet
Keep me set apart
I soon get some rest
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Everyone still talks about
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
I got into the driver's seat
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
The slowest now will later be fast
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
You don't forget
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
One more night the moon is shining bright
We can hold up a toast if we meet
There's some people that
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
That might be all that you got
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
The slow one now will later be fast
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
In the stillness of the midnight
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
To protect you and defend you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
But, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I can be just like you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I just might have to come see you
To be alone with you
And I tell this truth to you
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
The only one I know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
But sooner or later one of us must know
Don't it always a-go to show
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Don't it always go to show
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Sooner or later one of us must know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Well, I'd sure like to know
With only you in view
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Now, you're probably wondering by now
He been living there three years now
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
It only goes to show
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
I'd sure like to know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
My mind weaves a symphony
For them that think death's honesty
But I can't deny
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Went to the doctor the very next day
Maggie says that many say
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
And the ladies treat me kindly
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
If I don't take the chance to try
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Is worth more than I could pay
Spouted out that liberty
From phony jealousy
And that which you've given me today
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
To those condemned to act accordingly
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
How many times must the cannon balls fly
So I run down most hurriedly
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
And the only tune my guitar could play
The same thing I would want today
Well, I saw it advertised one day
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
And it's up to you to say
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
That I was just a puppet in a play
I did not do it harmfully
My ears hear a symphony
So, I'm walking down your highway
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Or if you just want some company
We banged the drum slowly
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
But I wish there was something you would do or say
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Though I'd never say
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
She knocked upon it anyway
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
But you can never steal away
A cock is crowing far away
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
No, you'll not now or no other day
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
And for His love they took His life away
Don't you tell Henry
That I done it the way
For them that think death––death's honesty
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
And I'm leaving every day to run away
She puts it to me plain as day
For them that must obey authority
I send you all my money
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
So they took him to the infirmary
The Spanish-American War had its day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
She smiles, walks the other way
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Ha–va–
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
As suicide remarks are torn –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Private reasons – great or small –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
There oughtta be a law against you coming around –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Havana–gee–
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Hang out the whole next day –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
You will not hear a laugh –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Turn, turn, turn again –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I a-hope you can hear––
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
I got no idea what I want –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Disconnect these cables––
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
It's just a ragged clown behind –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Leave all the children home –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Oh, my–
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books –
You should be made to be wearing a telephone –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Havanagee–luh–
They crammed me back into the county jail –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Though its glow is waxed in black –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
I hope that you can hear––
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
How badly they were shocked –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
First degree and second degree –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I long to hold you in the night –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Indians camp along her border –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
I'm sure it was not three –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
What you're gonna say when you get home –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
To know where you are –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
Haven't seen her since that night –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Hava–na–
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
