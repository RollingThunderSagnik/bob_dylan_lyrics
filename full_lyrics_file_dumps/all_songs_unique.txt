And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!

All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!

68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Dance!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Hope I don't find out too much!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
You can't blame me at all."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
They look as white as snow."
We'll both go home together."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And pretend that you never have met."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
You and I'll never know."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"That way down Highway 61."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
You must know about my debutante."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Where you and I will unite."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
But I know what you want."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
But we were tangled up in blue."
I can't find my knees."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
We want folksingers here."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
For that reason I will have to stay."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
That you must always first forgive them."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
I'll apply them all to thee."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
And hung on a willow tree."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
And have it on Highway 61."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
And it's all for the love of thee."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
They look as dark as night."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Will mourn for your return."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
You can't blame us at all."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Tangled up in blue."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
We'll both go off together."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Have it on Highway 61."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
I didn't see you around."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
And punched my cigarette."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
I love far better than thee."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
I'll bring back my lady."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Come flowing down so free?"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
And keep him good company."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Country'll grow."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
I would want again tomorrow."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
He said, "Tell me about it."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Would kill a little bird like me."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
So write to her tenderly."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Is it easy to forget?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
I'll endow them onto thee."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
I'll see her soon, I know."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
It's all for the love of thee."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
My dear, sweet friend,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
I can't be good, baby,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
You have laid down Your life for me,
More people kept a-piling on,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Silhouetted by the sea,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Without ideals or violence,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Every nerve is analyzed,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
If'n you don't know by now,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
The day would surely have to break,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
God knows when,
Joey, Joey,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Heart of mine, be still,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
To stay closer than any friend,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
To gather flowers constantly,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Aim well, my little one,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
They say every man need protection,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
You have given everything to me,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
You don't want a love that's pure,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Stone you just like they said they would,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
God don't call it wrong,
Tell her not to worry,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Don't let her see,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Under the microscope,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Advertising signs, they con,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
And you take just like a woman,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Baby, please stop crying,
He's not selling any alibis,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Or have done something wrong,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Don't let yourself fall,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
To be one your own,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Better jump down the manhole,
Don't let her hear,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
I couldn't see where we were going,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Get dressed, get blessed,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Icicles hanging down,
Circled by the circus sands,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
To be––direction home,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Now, won't you tell me true,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
I been good,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I'd give you the sky high above,
This world is ruled by violence,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
A complete unknown,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Heart of mine,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Who could they get to carry you,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
She's opened up a happy home,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Makes no difference where she's been,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
God knows it's a crime,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Is it really any wonder,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Oh, in somebody's room,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
There's always someone who understands,
That you'd have liked me to,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Simplify you, classify you,
The man in the trench-coat,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
"Not me," said his manager,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Madams light the candles,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Like a rolling stone,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
I can change, I swear,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
When I was in Missouri,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
She's the worst you could ever have,
And there's two white horses following me,
Drifting too far from shore,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
That long, black train is pulling down,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
But I'm saved,
I'd be sad and blue,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
For she ain't the same,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
And to come each time you call,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Father of day, father of night,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
They must bust in early May,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
God knows it's a struggle,
It's not aimed at anyone,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
I got the worried blues,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Well, I can't understand,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Come all without, come all within,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The joint is jumping,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Far past the frozen leaves,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
You have given me life to live,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
I run right home and I went to bed,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
I just don't know what to do,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Says he's got a bad cough,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
To protect his white skin,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I'm going out of my mind,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Why she did go,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
But, if I will save you the time,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
And furnish me with tape,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
My hands can't feel to grip,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Like a dog on a chain,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Love that's pure no accident,
Up and down the block,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Tell me,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
For her to arrive,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
All the silver, all the gold,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
God sees it all unfold,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Ooh, watered-down love,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
He's young and on fire,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
The wind blowing the snow around,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
In one the surface was frozen,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
All the tired horses in the sun,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
I'll be on my way,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
From their fates try to resign,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Cares not to come up any higher,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Get back, write Braille,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I went into the red, went into the black,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Ever since I been a child,
The night would see me wide awake,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Seven days,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Friends with you,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
It could even be like a myth,
Watered-down love,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
So, never leave me lonely,
My love, she speaks softly,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
And played the fife lowly,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
With his fist in a clinch,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
We've killed each one,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
And ride a horse along the trail,
He got that soft, silky skin,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
And also by his feet,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Like as not, it's better so,
At the close of the day,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
They say every man must fall,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Or select you or dissect you,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
The man there said he loved my sound,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Day you quit me, baby,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
The sky too is folding under you,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
But it ain't him to blame,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
I been good while I been waiting,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Searching high, searching low,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
I'm never, never far from home,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Try to be a success,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
The only son of God Almighty,
If I didn't have to guess,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
You need something to open your eyes,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
For his age he is wise,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
May be the head of some big TV network,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Precious angel under the sun,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Automobile coming into style,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Like some mystery,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Out to the windy beach,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
It always has hit me from below,
That fired the gun,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I would not feel so all alone,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Well, I may just swear,
Stone you when you are young and able,
God knows everything,
True love of mine,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
But I've been hanging on,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
I'm pledging my time to you,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Where life and death are memorized,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
So many roads, so much at stake,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
The light I never knowed,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
The sky too is folding over you,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Look away, you rolling river,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
My limbs are shaking,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
In the great unknown,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Over the hills and far away,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
You even make love just like a woman,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
My senses have been stripped,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
I rambled out of New York town,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
I'm going down the river,
I try my best to be just like I am,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
God knows it's true,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Till both of us fell by the way,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
I can make it through,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Stripping away at it all,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Well, I been gambling so long,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Vanished from my hand,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Well, I'm pressing on,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
People carry roses,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
That five walls cannot hide him,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
In the lonely night,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Yes, I'm pressing on,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
And it's only that I'm asking,
God knows there's a chance,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
I'm leaving today,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
God knows it's terrifying,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
You want watered-down love,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
You're beautiful beyond words,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
Searching everywhere I know,
All I really wanna do,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
If anything is gonna sell,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
And, if I see the day,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
I march in the parade of liberty,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Somewhere down the road some day,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
And I got those worried blues,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
I know I can't win,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
God knows there's a purpose,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
The one we can see and can feel,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I went back home, put on my tie,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Six months on the chain gang,
I've been in and out of happiness,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
To a solid rock,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Never needed to call you my whore,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
If your time to you is worth saving,
They say that every man must fall,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
With the juice running down my leg,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Well, well, well,
For all intended purposes,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
And, if I can save you any time,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
The phone's tapped anyway,
I try my best to be like I am,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
It was from her ship sailing,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Without a dream in my heart,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
It all seemed so well-timed,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
You could look at it and weep,
Yesterday is just a memory,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Broken lines, broken strings,
I went down where the vultures feed,
I got those worried blues,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
It's really something,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
You're beautiful to me,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
You always responded when I needed your help,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Yesterday's just a memory,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
The air is getting hotter,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Need a woman all the time,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
God knows you've got to weep,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
He is centuries old,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Carved next to his name,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
And it's like I ain't here,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Keep me where you are,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
May be living in another country under another name,
Ain't no going back,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
But the bottles are done,
Yet every distance is not near,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Since you've been gone,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
But the time ain't tall,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Well, get sick, get well,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
That two healers cannot heal him,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Too noble to neglect,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Loyalty, unity,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
I just can't beg you anymore,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
But it ain't me, babe,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
How he died nobody can say,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Hang around the ink-well,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
It hurts me, too,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
You find God in the church of your choice,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
I can't cross the line, you know,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
I shall be released,
That her father was going to hang,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
And you make love just like a woman,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
And forget my pride,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
We never much thought we could get very old,
And it still ain't me, babe,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
New morning,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Thieving in the alley,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
But ye shall be a-changed,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
I won't have my nature way,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
And, though the line is cut,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Don't follow leaders,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
A million faces at my feet,
You can raise up your right hand,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
If you can't quit your sinning,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
God knows there's a heaven,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
In the darkness of my night,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Far away from it all,
But now morning is clear,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
In the turning of twilight,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Don't let her see where you're going,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, I don't mind dying,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Gonna serve somebody,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Well, the job that you used to have,
It still ain't me, babe,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
If ever I prove false to you,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Father of air and father of trees,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
I got my mind made up,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
My love, she speaks like silence,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
I never can go because, you know,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
In the end,
You got to serve somebody,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Try hard, get barred,
Without a love of my own,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
A foreign sound to your ear,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Read books, repeat quotations,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
As his youth now unfolds,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
When God and man will be reconciled,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Stand up straight and tall,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
When I seen him lose control,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
But, if I can save you any time,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Made before the foundation of the world,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Going,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Holding his club like he was a king,
She would have married me,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
You need something to open up a new door,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Without your sweet love,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
We live in a political world,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
You to me were true,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Don't let me drift too far,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
If not for you,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Every moon is so sanctified,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Human gods aim for their mark,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
And it ain't me, babe,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
If she ain't feeling well,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Where mercy walks the plank,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Get born, keep warm,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
She's crying like an evil stone,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Don't let me change my heart,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
But, if you want me to,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Serve somebody,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Is used, it is plain,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Carry the New York Times,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
The beat is pumping,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I threw it all away,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Don't let her know that you love her,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Far away and over the wall,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
God knows how to make it flow,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Father of black, father of white,
Too serious to fool,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Each time we meet, love,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Trouble,
May you stay forever young,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
The Second World War came to an end,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I'd already gone the distance,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
How does it feel,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Said I'm pressing on,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Someone to open each and every door,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Most of the time it's well understood,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
If you must cling to someone,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
You and me, we had completeness,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Just like a rolling stone,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Never did feel this way before,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
She'll surely turn to white,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Staying far behind without you,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
For the wise men and the fools,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Nothing too very scientific,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Private reasons, great or small,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Of this I can't say very much,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Who will promise never to part,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
For the politician's gain,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
And think they're fooling you,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
By rivers of blindness,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
But he's the property of Jesus,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Says he's got a bad bill,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I'm so glad,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
But it would not be new,
My arms and legs were broken,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
On the stone that remains,
Resent him to the bone,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
And I'm just like that bird,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
You've got to serve somebody,
And the table's full and overflowed,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
They lowered him down as a king,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
We'll fly the night away,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Just to know that you are near,
It's too bad he had to go,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
And she aches just like a woman,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
When the night comes falling,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
And I'm so glad,
Looking 'bout the government,
You got something I want plenty of,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
You can run down to the desert,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
I went out last night to take a little round,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
How he died nobody could say,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
But he can't be blamed,
To be alone with you,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Stay away from the train line,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
By users, cheaters,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
With no direction home,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
I wish I a-was a magician,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And to come every time you call,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
I found my world, found my world in you,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
It was a girl I learned it from,
And point away from the past,
Laying low,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
To be without a home,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Oh, see what you can do,
So glad,
Far away in the stormy night,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
And on the highway of regret,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
And gathering storms may arise,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
I think we better talk this over,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Look who's back in town,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Like a complete unknown,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Mixing up the medicine,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
I had a dream about you, baby,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Yes, I want you so bad,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
The day you quit me, baby,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Don't wear sandals,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
One by one they follow the sun,
Wintertime in New York town,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
But I know that he don't talk,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I just keep pressing on,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
I want you so bad,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Look out, kid,
In the instant that I preach,
It always means so much,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
But something has changed,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Watch the river flow,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
I got two white horses following me,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
When there is no more,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Just remember that death is not the end,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
China doll, alcohol,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Someone to close his heart,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Keep a clean nose,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
And here I sit so patiently,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
One by one they followed the sun,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
God knows there's a river,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
And, although that we're single and free,
The night passed away so quickly,
Of ancient history,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
In his anger and his shame,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
One summer's day he came passing by,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
While riding on a train going west,
I got a bird that whistles,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Memory, ecstasy,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
With his candle lit into the sun,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Just like I did before,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Never weak, but always strong,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
And may you stay forever young,
Not the end, not the end,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Each one playing a horn,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
No, nothing was delivered,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
To your tambourine in time,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Don't ever try to change me,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Everything's a-hers or his,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
They say every man needs protection,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
And, if anybody asks me,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
With what your fate is going to be,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
And your streets are getting empty,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
With a killer's pride, security,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
Just don't know what to do,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Better jump down a manhole,
Strangers all give me the news,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
So unknown,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Pressing on,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Can't find what I need,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
In the ruins of your balcony,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
They keep it all hid,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Went back home to the yard,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
God knows that, when you see it,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Like you never did before,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
First degree and second degree,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
I swung on to my old guitar,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
You wanna drown love,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
I don't care if you feel like me,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Where the neon madmen climb,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Don't try No Doz,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
It's alright,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
There she come, now, down my way,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I went into the city, into the town,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
She once was a true love of mine,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Mercury, gravity,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
You have explained every mystery,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
As the present now will later be past,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Watch the plain-clothes,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
That must be what it's all about,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Oxford Town around the bend,
All you can do is do what you must,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Waiting for the trains,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Going, going, gone,
And, on their promises of paradise,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
But you try with your whole soul,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
They say every man must need protection,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
God knows it's fragile,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Grandpa died last week,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Bring the wife and family,
Winter would have no spring,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
But, deep inside my heart,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Corrina, Corrina,
All them prophets good and gone,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
The carpet too is moving under you,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
To shine in through,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
I've been around this whole country,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Eh, singing just for you,
And she'll be coming forth,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Got my mind made up,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Analyze you, categorize you,
If you'd see me this way,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
If today was not a crooked highway,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Got me a secret membership card,
True love, they've been without it,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
I wish tonight were here,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Don't tie no bows,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Don't wanna be a bum,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Father of night, father of day,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
The kingdoms of experience,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
She'll be coming forth,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
You gotta look some other place,
When she lays upon the grass,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Saved,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
And the point is slick,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
People talk of situations,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
We take great delight in our own company,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
And come every time you call,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
To be on your own,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
I had no one for to go my bail,
My woman needs it every day,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
I'll go see them come down my way,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
And I got the worried blues,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
You made it there somehow,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
How many a year has passed and gone,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Eh, in somebody's room,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Something about you that I can't shake,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
I've been saved – well, alright,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
I thank the Lord,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
To know how much I really care,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
I just say no thanks,
I got a wife and five little children,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
"Not I," said the referee,
To be so useless and all,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Name of Martin Luther King,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Looking for a new fool,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Thank You, Lord,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
In the foggy web of destiny,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
A handle hid out in the dark,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
But I'm pressing on,
You were striped, you were plain,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
But, to remain as friends,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
But evidently she don't,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Every brain is civilized,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
You have given all there is to give,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
You got something better,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
And pretend that we never have touched,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
And not going through any great extreme,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
"Come along and take a trip,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
A thousand miles from home,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
On this new morning, new morning,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
One by one until there were none,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
She got great big hind legs,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Stone you and say good luck,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
But you're doing it again,
Don't you tell Henry,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Broken hands on broken plows,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I'm going back to Colorado,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
They tell me every man must fall,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Heart of mine, go back home,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
You have given me eyes to see,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Don't matter what you did,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Using every angle under the sun,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Ye shall be changed,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I can't understand,
To strict party-platform ties,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
They say every distance is not near,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
And you know I could never be your own,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I want you,
You married young just like your ma,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Father of loneliness and pain,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Whether you are right or wrong,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
I bless the day I found you,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
The Communists was a-coming around,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
A man named Martin Luther King,
And comes to a permanent stop,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Had no one to go my bail,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
I don't care if you analyze me,
If you throw it all away,
Love don't have any place,
That the laws are with him,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
You don't have to feed me,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Relationships of ownership,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
A hand set the spark,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
It's a price I have to pay,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
That foreign sound in your ear,
They don't believe in mercy,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Into my own parade,
Don't steal, don't lift,
And I'm in the shade,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Where I will always be renewed,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
That they do not respect in any degree,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
May be an actor in a plot,
You better chew gum,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
They took a clean-cut kid,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
She said she would never forget,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Judge and jury took their stand,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Oh, singing just for you,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
When all will be well,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
And give him back the time he's done,
You stole her love from me one day,
Just then the order came to charge,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
She leave by the other and roam,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Baby, let me follow you down,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Oh, watered-down love,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
I been riding the midnight train,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
She said she would always stay,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
I can see the turning of the key,
At ships with tattooed sails,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Tell me that you love me only,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
And I'm back in the rain,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Adiós, mi corazón,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
To hang and to lynch,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
A dream about you, baby,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
In the hills of mystery,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Already the fiesta has begun,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Badge out, laid off,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Make you spin or do you in,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Oh, Angelina,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Beating for the dead that rise,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
I'd only have to stay,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
It was you who came right through,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
You'll change your last name, too,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Forever young, forever young,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
To have––be on your own,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
This situation can only get rougher,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
No direction home,
The country doctor rambles,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
They––they show me to the door,
Go down to the river, babe,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
That can do what's never been done,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Trust yourself,
I get my sweet reward,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
I had so much left to do,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Precious memories, how they linger,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
I want my arms around you,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Watching the river flow,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
See you fly or watch you die,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I need a shot of love,
Alright, I'm so glad,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Made of silver or of golden,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
But you were gambling for support,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Face full of black soot,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
In the shadows of moonlight,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
For something that he never done,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
That fellow who never blushes,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Speaking to some French girl,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
But I would not feel so all alone,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
You were snow, you were rain,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Go melt back in the night,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Is looking for a new fool,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Thinking about the government,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
To be out on your own,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Wasn't making any great connection,
To find out if she's talked,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Well, I'm so glad,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
To keep up his hate,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
God knows it's outta sight,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Want you so bad,
I don't wanna fake you out,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
A true love of mine,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
The country music station plays soft,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Light yourself a candle,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
The winter would hold no spring,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
By losers, cheaters,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
While paupers change possessions,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Give you my money, honey,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I landed up on the downtown side,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
They say everything can be replaced,
You will be alright, girl,
It's rising up above my head,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Want you,
Dream about you, baby,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
People talk over situations,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Equality, liberty,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
He been around the world and back again,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Honey, just for you to climb,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Every head is so dignified,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
He's the property of Jesus,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Three angels up above the street,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
So I got those worries blues,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
He won't do nothing to you,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
People going down to the ground,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Go away from my window,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
I once held her in my arms,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Over your senses you have no control,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
The night blows cold and rainy,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
God don't call it treason,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
A man with a badge skips by,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Going, going,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
In a pine box for all eternity,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Father of minutes, father of days,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Two by two they step in the dark,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Don't let her know,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Don't let her see that you need her,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
And the whole world is on your case,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
You had enough of hatred,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Front door shut, back door too,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
She never does me wrong,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
God knows you ain't pretty,
I have no one to meet,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Ten thousand men on the move,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
It don't matter what you did,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Well, come all without, come all within,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
I got no place left to turn,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Precious father, loving mother,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Pick you up every time you fall,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Going home,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
In love and with kindness,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
I should have left this town this morning,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Eh, see what you can do,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Come on, come on, stick together,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
It's like I ain't here,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
My hands didn't touch him none,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
But, it ain't me, babe,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Nothing was delivered,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
And all of your children start to resent you,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
That's where you belong --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Democracy don't rule the world --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Someone who will die for you and more.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
You have no idea what you do to me.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
I once held her in my arms.
From the little Minnesota town.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
He gone north for a while.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Who always was too proud to beg.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
"And light on my right knee.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
I'd give anything to be with you.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
When she's better only time'll tell.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
And pretend that we never have touched.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
When my memory is not so short.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
When you go your way and I go mine.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
With the glory that is to be.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
Lord, protect my child.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Oh, Angelina.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
You don't have to be afraid.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
I shall be released.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
With an iron chain around his neck.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
With gold and silver in her hand.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Under the midnight moon.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
You are on the bottom.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Yes, I guess I loved him too, I can still see him in my mind climbing that hill.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Means another poor boy is underground.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
About an old man that never done wrong.
The sooner you can leave.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
And she'll only know he's dead.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
I hate bears.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
It was all over by a quarter past.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Going through all these things twice.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
To keep her from the howling winds.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
It would go up against every rule.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
"And stay all night with me.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
With the golden loom.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
At my window with a broken wing.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
At the end of the trail.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Step lightly on the ground.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
And no time to think.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
That number eleven was closing.
I'm just average, common too.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
So many people I never saw in my life.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
And I've never been too impressed.
I know you always say that you agree.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Someone's watching over you.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
So the radio didn't work so well.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Ever since I seen her smile.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Ever since I seen you there.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Broken voices on broken phones.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
That set everybody free.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
And then unto eternity.
It ain't quite the end.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.

Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
And all your raging glory.
Blood on your saddle.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.

He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.

You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.

Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
People bending broken rules.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
If I ride back again.
"Don't trill no news on me.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
Just remember that death is not the end.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Memories of what used to be.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
And there wasn't any difference to me.

A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
To hold me in your arms.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
A man named Martin Luther King...
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Tell me.

That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Girls like birds fly away.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
Just what he was talking about.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
You only got ten.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
I don't care what in the world you do.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Is when I'm alone with you.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
I don't even know why we come.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
You break your promise all over the place.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
In the night the price was paid.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
My mind is breaking.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
And discovered her invisible self.
Looking for the places only they would know.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
I only saw what they let me see.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Soft as music, light as spring.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
And relive my dreams.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
You can show me a new place to start.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
At not getting their money's worth.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
For that's the way I remember her best.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
And laid his life on the line.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
I been worrying about you, baby.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Never been so easy or so slow.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
That can win what's never been won.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
As if a wedding vow.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Some place so high above this wall.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
I need a shot of love.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
And disregards the rest.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
Most of the time.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Join the army if you fail.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
He's only a pawn in their game.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Greenwich Village.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
And the night blows rainy.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
And I was brought up by my brother.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
And you must realize the danger.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
But, when war came, he volunteered and forgot the white man's greed.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
There was nobody around.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Unless they're from another world.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
A true love of mine.
As the present now will later be past.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
But I know that I can't move.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
But you break just like a little girl.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
The next day could be your last.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Quite clear. no doubt, somehow.
You were always so close and still within reach.
To kill with no pain.
Please quit your low-down ways.
I can't hear you anymore.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Going, going, gone.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Or put up against the wall.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
The whole night through.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Never will want for money.
I couldn't find any.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
For the times, they are a-changing.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
No kindred or relative nigh.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
See like me or be like me.
It's just the same as talking to you.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
I got a bird that sings.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Got to have done some evil deed.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Bid farewell forever.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
And wait for succeeding kings.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
Come on, darling.
And the morning will be breaking.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
I can't see through it anymore.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
They would not let me be.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
And that failure's no success at all.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.

Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
And I need you, yeah.
Everybody's having them dreams.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
Just crying out that he was framed.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
I seen a man.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
His voice was low with pain.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
There's no words that need to be said.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
To see what kinda words he could say.

"Get well, get well," said she.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
And come away with me.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Remember me to one who lives there.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
That's the way I remember her best.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Carry for you deep down inside.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.

His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
And I do hope you receive it well, depending on the way you feel that you live.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.

Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.

Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
And tapestry of rhyme.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
But these to tell what's true.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
You cast your spell and I went under.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Baby, two feet from the well.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Heart of mine.

'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
May you stay forever young.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
You got it, baby.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Crying out that he been framed.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
So, darling, you better come through.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
She said she would always stay.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
And ye shall be changed.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.

When you made everybody pay.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
And it never seemed strange.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
You can say I didn't give to you.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.

Sweet lady.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.

To reach of your rattling drums.
Now you don't talk so loud.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
You're on the bottom.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.

She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
I long to reach for you in the night.

She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Leave no stone unturned.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.

I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
In an oil refinery.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
The hour when the ship comes in.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
A foreign sound to your ear.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.

Take me as I am or let me go.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.

Six by six...
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.

This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.

Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
I didn't feel so cold then.

You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Until my dying-day.

And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.

So I beg you: let it be me.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
In the summertime when you were with me.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
Blues wrapped around my head.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.

She made well sure her neighbors understood.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.

But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.

And I've a-never been too impressed.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.

I never saw the man again.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
What you'll say when you get home.

Stone you, they'll be back again.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.

The bottom of the barrel is too.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.

People sleeping in broken beds.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.

Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
'Cause I don't think about it.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.

Foundationed deep somehow.
Than people who are most content.
I just can't see through it anymore.
After losing every battle.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
You can have love, but you might lose it.

Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.

She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.

But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
While my conscience explodes.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.

When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.

Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.

On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.

If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Someone to open each and every door.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
If you just let me follow you down.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
If not for you.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
Precious memories flood my soul.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Looking for a new friend.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
A-lord, protect my child.
My face you'll never see no more.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Even the softest touch.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
The night will soon be gone.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
When my working day's through.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
I had so little time to fail.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
I said that.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
That just struck me kinda funny.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
With all these promises you left for me.
Her fond face pale with woe.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Orders from the D.A.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
All because his face was brown.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
Life don't mean a thing.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning him with words.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Fear to bring children into the world.
And the people that confronted him were many.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
Everything inside is made of stone.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
And he was a friend of mine.
To know which way the wind blows.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
By the saving grace that's over me.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
We were the wrong side.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
Drink up your blood like wine.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Oh, yes, they did.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
Honey, baby.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Everything is gonna be fine.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
Your son is coming back from the war.
Gonna serve somebody.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
But I can't get close to her at all.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Thought I was a communist.
Behind a man's brain.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
But my heart just won't give in.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Last radio is playing.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
I hope you're ready.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Neighborhood bully.
I took some comfort there.
Humility, simplicity.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Honey, come and see about me.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
When I'm alone with you.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
I know something is changed.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
When I paint my masterpiece.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
Havanageeluh.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
I been in this thing too long.
An innocent man in a living hell.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
68, but says he's 24.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Hope I don't blow it.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
But I was raised on the other.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Suffering like a fool.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I'm younger than that now.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
I will only let you down.
Where teardrops fall.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Bring that bottle over here.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
Need that woman straight and true.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
That old ship was a-going down.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
I'm in trouble with the tombstone blues.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
We may not make it through the night.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Mortality, reality.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
And light on your right knee.
I can't use it anymore.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
Oh, got my mind made up.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
In the border-towns of despair.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
I'll remember you.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
She murdered mortal he.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
While I'm in the hall.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Rode slowly back again.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
I got nothing to go back to now.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Crumble into one another.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Some speak of the future.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
He's the neighborhood bully.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Under the hedges.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
In the palace of the Pope.
Must be and that is all.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Go lightly on the ground.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.

I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
High society, notoriety.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.

So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
Drifting too far from shore.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
She can't find him anywhere.
For an instant hand touched hand.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
It was you who understood.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
To live it you had to explode.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Honey, I want you.
New morning.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
In the pale moonlight.
If you won't come out your window.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
Rain would gather too.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Slowly into autumn.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
The time and the place that we'd part.
To the old folks' home and the college.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
I got trouble in my mind.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
Now and forever let it be me.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
And your golden loom.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
I see better days and I do better things.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
The same as my father before him.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Chain you down or bring you down.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
His mama sure was proud of him.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
And shot it fulla holes.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
You can make it too.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
We all know for sure that it's real.
It don't matter anyhow.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Trying to create a next world war.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
And there's no time to think.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
You got a heart of stone.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Look how sweet she sleep, how free must be her dream.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
And the mailbox is locked.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Tangled up in blue.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Throw my ticket out the window.
It can't be this way everywhere.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
You want a watered-down love.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
I got nothing left to burn.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
In the brightness of my day.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
Or define you or confine you.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Hope that it don't sleet.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Yes, tell me.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
You'd better get that in your head.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Baby, let me follow you down.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Heading for the gates of Eden.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
Baby, baby...
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
If it just don't make me hurts.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
I'm going where I never been before.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
To be alone with you.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Go find out something only dead men know.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
And just set there waiting for me to come.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
And they gotta cut something.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
You to me were the best.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Our chances really was a million to one.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I had something to protect.
From my toes up to my ears.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Who says she knows me well.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Calling out that he's been framed.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
But she had some way of finding them out.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
Hmm, tell me.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Walking around with no one else.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
Please let me ride you home.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
Evidently she won't.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
And ye shall be a-changed.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
Baby, baby.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
And I need you, ah.
Don't remember one thing more.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Chain you down or be your clown.
I can't fire them anymore.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
All because of the color of his skin.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
She pretends like we never have met.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Somebody better investigate soon.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
He's always on trial for just being born.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
It always does when you're with me.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
If you just let me come home with you.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
That Johanna's not here.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Mine alone.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Good car to drive, after a war.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Oh, convey herself away.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Hoping you'll come through too.
See that my grave is kept clean.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
But all I see are dark eyes.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.

The stores one by one, they're folding.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Patriotism, materialism.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
Lay dead beside him there.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Can't see over to the other side.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
To see that you're madly in love.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
But simply because it's true.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Everything is broken.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
You give something up for everything you gain.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
And make promises by the hours.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Rain would gather, too.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.

But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Hmm.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
And you only got ten.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
On the caboose of the train.
When I run outta things to investigate.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
And watch the parking meters.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
By the jealousy of others around her.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
And get something quick to eat.
It only brings me sorrow.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Until I threw it all away.
You always got more than enough rope.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Living down Sonora way.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
I didn't realize how young you were.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
You sound like a hillbilly.

Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.

Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Waiting on my burying ground.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
Close your eyes, close the door.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
But you're back where you belong.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
Buildings going up to the sky.
And I want you to be that woman.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
And gives it to me for a song.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
I see that stationmaster too.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
By that soft and shining sea.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
And one day he came passing by.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
My baby stole my heart from me.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Valentines can't buy her.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
With my suitcase in my hand.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
You're my honey.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
I'd like to know.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
I want everybody to be free.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Epitome, rigidity.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Gone as the season she's taken.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Some place so high above the wall.
That which is not permanent don't last.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
In fond memory appear.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
And clouds cover up the ground.

Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
Just like so many times before.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
It don't matter, anyhow.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
That last night I was with.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Everybody must get stoned.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
If you throw it all away.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Honey, I never would have come.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
The National Guard stands around the door.
You may not see me tomorrow.
In the dark land of the sun.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Duality, mortality.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.

There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:

Till I come into New York town:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:

Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:

Man is opposed to fair play:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:

I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Some speak of the future;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Had to be held down by big police;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Crumble into one another;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
I find complete love;
Make promises by the hour;
All lies and jest;
Everybody that was hanging out;

<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Here's an unrecorded song. See if you can guess which one it is.</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Where did you lose your wings?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
What can I give to You?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
What else can a poor boy do?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Why must you always try to make me over?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Before he can see the sky?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
What's wrong with you this time?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
That too many people have died?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Where did you hide your halo?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
When did you leave heaven?
How's everything in heaven?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
How many more without any reward?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
How does it feel?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, where are you tonight?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
How can I live for You?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Can you get back in?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Like a rolling stone?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Has anybody seen my love?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Across the swamp of time?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How much poison did they inhale?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
How could they ever mistake you?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Am I ready?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Before they're forever banned?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Before you call him a man?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
When he's standing in front of you?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why would I want to take your life?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
To love and follow His direction?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Are you ready?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Of everything you see?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Before he can hear people cry?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
What can I do for You?
How could they let you go?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
What would life be?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Did you respect me for what I did?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
By golly, what more can I say?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
And one deserving of affection?
Before it's washed to the sea?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
How many more can they afford?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Have they missed you?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Can I come home with you?
What good am I?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Gal, where you been so long?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Why and what's the reason for?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Oh, how could you refuse?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Does anyone even try?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Is it rolling, Bob?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Baby, can't you tell?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Across the swooping plain?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
The love that a stranger might receive?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
For all these earthly things?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Must everybody bow?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Just like a rolling stone?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Who killed Davey Moore?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
And how does it feel?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Too many people have died?
How many compared to yesterday?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Baby, what more can I tell?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Oh, so why not you and me?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
He wagged his tail and shook his head
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Everything stays down where it's wounded
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
I want you, baby, just to understand
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
"Equality". I spoke the word
I live in another world
While some, on principles baptized
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
But something has changed
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Now, a very great man once said
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
We live in a political world
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
He was a clean-cut kid
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Now, whenever I get up and
Roving gambler, he was very bored
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
To see him obviously framed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
I will not go down under the ground
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
They took a clean-cut kid
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
It's something you did
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
I'll always thank the Lord
But now something has changed
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
And those whom doom and death had spared
She let go of my hand
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Now you don't act so––so proud
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Silvio, silver and gold
So I'll make my stand
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Now you don't seem so proud
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
And that even the nobles get properly handled
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
And things would be different the next time we wed
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Just what you had in mind
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
As I stand upon the sand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
The changes I was going through can't even be used
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
And into the path you are hurled
Things would be different the next time we wed
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
But all that suffering was not to be compared
You used to be so amused
I run right home and I went to bed
For what you sold that's not been received
All the sweethearts you can hold
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Many times I've often prayed
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
You used––be so proud
But she ain't gonna find the road
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
And then you told me later as I apologized
Then came the warning that was before the flood
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Its iron claws attached
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
I still can remember the way that you smiled
How many times can a man turn his head
Nothing was delivered
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
I thought that it was well-understood
Either from the mountains of Madrid
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
And your trouble is you know it too good
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
You try so hard, but you don't understand
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
By no special friend
I've been walking around
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Somebody seen him hanging around
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Maybe someday you will understand
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
There ain't nothing in this world
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
When I'm all alone
Well, six white horses that you did promise
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
So I look like a walking mountain range
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Limited in sex they dare
What about that millionaire
If dogs run free, why not we
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
While them that defend what they cannot see
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
I rode with him in a taxi once
When the rain is blowing in your face
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Among the lovely people living free
And plenty time for good romance
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
What good am I then to others and me
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Though its shadow's metal badge
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
When the roses fade
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
You cut to the core
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Hunger pays a heavy price
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
You say you're looking for someone
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Just pick anyone
Waiting to find out what price
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
From all the plans they do pursue
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
The crashing waves roll over me
Knows there's no success like failure
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
But I can get another one
Remember me to one who lives there
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
To give the special one you seek a chance
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
I don't even notice she gone
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
So, I called up the operator of time
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
From the start by the rule
With all memory and fate
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Looking at hands for the lines that were
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
How was I to know you'd be the one
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
We see this empty cage now corrode
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
There were times when I was so lonesome
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
On the rising curve
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
They say don't come back no more
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
I'm ready for to fade
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
You just pick anyone
And I would send a message
Up into some paradise
The man the authorities came to blame
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
And the Negro's name
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Lies that life is black-and-white
But the dark does die
You into thinking you're the one
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
The cause was there before we came
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
It'll be with me unto the grave
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Feel to moan, but unlike before
What's probably got you baffled more
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
She been gone
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
From the Golden Gate Bridge
I can survive and I can endure
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
It's all new to me
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Little did I realize
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Maybe someday you will look back and see
And you see why it's so unique to be
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Mona tried to tell me
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
What you're gonna say when you get home
And I ain't complaining none
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Says it's closing time
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
You said you'd never compromise
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
And that is that one must always flush out his house
She plunged him into well water where
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
He'll see by his grave
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Taking care of somebody nice
Should I put them by your gate
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
So I remember every face
Well, it's all new to me
All I feel is heat and flame
Full of hope and desire
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And suddenly there appeared before me
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
But I feel nothing for their game
Just what you will say when you get home
See the primitive wallflower freeze
I been wondering all about me
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
That she's the same one
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
How many ears must one man have
But it won't be over till they clear his name
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
If dogs run free, then what must be
She knows there's no success like failure
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
A bed that is never mine
And never sat once at the head of the table
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
"That I might be gone a long, old time
I am homeless, come and take me
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Leaving men wholly, totally free
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Remember me to the one who lives there
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Better stay away from those
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
You're not free to belong to me
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Should I leave them by your gate
"It's only you that he does crave
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
As he rises to fame
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
To show you something you seen before
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
I do declare
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
At dawn my lover comes to me
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
"Oh, father, you will surely die
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
If dogs run free, why not me
You know, it's not even safe no more
So up she picked her babies three
But I can't say I sympathize
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
For your weary toes to be a-touching
But then a whistle will be blowing
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I know that you know that I know that you show something
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
They're drinking up and walking
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
The order is rapidly fading
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
The order is a-rapidly fading
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
She rode by night and came by morning
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
If I was with her too long
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
'Cause the battle outside raging
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And there's no telling who that it's naming
For your weary toes to be touching
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
Where the time and the tempo drag
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Deceived me into thinking
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
The battle outside raging
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
There's nothing in here moving
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
It's not a bad way to make a living
You left me standing in the doorway crying
I can hear their hearts a-beating
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
I have fallen far beneath
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And how I know I'll make it through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Girls' faces formed the forward path
Then she told us how times were tough
Look out, the saints are coming through
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
You go north and you go south
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
I wish she'd unlock
Shoot in the back
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Make everything from toy guns that spark
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
The man in me will do nearly any task
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
You turn around to take a final peek
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
But they caught him and they brought him back
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Well, there ain't no going back
Her voice once and talk
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
How many seas must the white dove sail
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
And if my love is real
How many seas must a white dove sail
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
They ask me how I feel
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
A-how does it feel
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Then why don't she tell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
He's taught in his school
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
How does it feel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
As the last fire-truck from hell
A girl by the whirlpool
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
I chased me a woman up the hill
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Ring bell, hard to tell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Oh, how does it feel
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Well, if I die on top of the hill
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Ring bar, hard to tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
He's sure got a lot of gall
Muttering small talk at the wall
All and all can only fall
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
To make all that should be killed to crawl
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And remain as I am
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
"For you cannot relive them
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
You better not chew gum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
But I can hear another drum
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Two eyes took the aim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
But the second mother was with the seventh son
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
You take just like a woman
Please don't let on that you knew me when
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
There was little to say, there was no conversation
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
But me, I expected it to happen
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
She said that all the railroad men
Well, I'm hanging on
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
Their religion of the little ten women
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
You don't need a weatherman
Will not be understood as they're spoken
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Trying to get a lead on
But the post office has been stolen
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
In the pigpen
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And there's no exit in any direction
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Darkness at the break of noon
She got such a sweet disposition
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
The next morning she had awoken
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Somebody new to beat on
In ceremonies of the horsemen
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
All their daughters put me down
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
The ones that jump on the wagon
Well, you fake just like a woman
And she wakes just like a woman
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
She takes just like a woman
Advertising signs that con
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Guns and clubs followed him down
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
To remember the times when I was your only man
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
He got that fortress on the mountain
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
From heights that they could not gain
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
That long, black train is pulling down
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
For the loser now will be later to win
I'll be waiting at the station
And the smell of their roses does not remain
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Have died in battle or in vain
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Why did you trade heaven
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
You need something to make it known
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
A-she takes just like a woman
To my knowledge there's just one man
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
I don't even care if I ever see her again
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
But it's hard to think on
Uncle Rat went running downtown
And the corner sign
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Yes, and someone must explain
"Not me," said the gambling man
Out of the shower comes a football man
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
My love, she's like some raven
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
That long, black train is pulling on down
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
But all their daughters put me down
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
For the loser now might be later to win
How many roads must a man walk down
Suicide remarks are torn
Must meet the dawn
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
But the second mom was with the seventh son
How can the life of such a man
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And all their daughters put me down
And she aches just like a woman
And you ache a-just like a woman
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
But I swear I see my reflection
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
I figure maybe we're even
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
There is a place you go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Silvio, I gotta go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
There's nothing you can say or do
All I really wanna do
The very last thing that I'd want to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Every place I wanna go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
All I'd like you to do
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Aladdin and his lamp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What good am I while you softly weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Man in the coon-skin cap
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
How many times must a man look up
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
I say, "Why you say that for
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Still I've always kind of missed her
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Never no more do I wonder
So, don't fear if you hear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
All you boys better run for cover
Who came here from Cuba's door
But morning is clear
For I am married to a house carpenter
The lover who has just walked out your door
For all eternity I think I will remember
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
The wind howls like a hammer
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
When only you are near
Alone you stand with nobody near
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
She took him by his long, yellow hair
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
At any moment you could go under
And I don't even think about her
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I don't have to go far
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
In one I was running and in another
When you whispered in my ear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
The face of God will appear
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
I could feel a whole lot better
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I close my eyes and I wonder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Still I say her love-words over
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
You heard me saying a prayer for
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Glide across the lonely years
People carry roses
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Don't wear sandals
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Well, the ragman draws circles
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Girl by the whirlpool's
And I try to harmonize with songs
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
And, though the masters make the rules
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And then complains
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Seven days
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
On the back of the fish truck that loads
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Six-time users
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
What good am I if I say foolish things
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
And tells me of her dreams
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Thinking of a series of dreams
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
They whisper in the wings
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
But still remains
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Her window's wide open, African trees
I'd gladly confess
The cowboy angel rides
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
You can fall down on your knees
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
At times I think there are no words
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Now, you must provide some answers
I try to tell it like it is
He's not selling any alibis
To memorizing politics
You know that he has no intentions
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
To the cutting of fences
With a big bouquet of the roses
You should be made to wear earphones
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
True love can make a blade of grass
We living in times when men commit crimes
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Six-time losers
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
I was thinking of a series of dreams
As friends and other strangers
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
"Not me," said the man whose fists
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
But, though the masters make the rules
Statues made of matchsticks
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
And so Patty calls the cops
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And the poor white remains
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Romantic facts of musketeers
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
I let it slip gladly to my friends
I'm gonna let you pass
You never turned around to see the frowns
Mama, you know, awaits the news
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
And the princess and the prince discuss
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
People on the platforms
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Good and bad, I define these terms
And your father, to your sister he explains
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
When your mother sends back all your invitations
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Don't follow leaders
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
With a fantastic collection of stamps
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Wants eleven dollar bills
To sharpen the senses
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
That it's you and no one else that owns
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
You been hurt so many times
The slow one now will later be fast
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Oh, everybody's got to eat
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Everyone still talks about
But, if the arrow is straight
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
In the precious winds they rot
They tell me revenge is sweet
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
It don't take too long to find out
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
How many years can a mountain exist
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Everything is always right
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
And the first one now will later be last
Wait for the morning light
I'm on the pavement
Keep me set apart
Talking that the heat put
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
I soon get some rest
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
In the stillness of the midnight
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And I, in my armor, turning about
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
To hold each other tight
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
I think that it's best
Every new messenger bringing evil report
You're gonna get hit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
With your pockets well protected at last
By the way, that's a cute hat
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
How many years can some people exist
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
He really wasn't where it's at
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
One more night I will wait for the light
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
You're hearing my heart beat
So he never thinks straight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Someday, everything is gonna be different
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Keep it in your mind and not forget
I got into the driver's seat
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Like a corkscrew to my heart
That might be all that you got
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
You used to laugh about
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
You used to laugh–make fun about
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
They tell me to be discreet
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
The slowest now will later be fast
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Plants in the bed, but
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Without any doubt
One more night the moon is shining bright
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
You are there in the flickering light
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
And, since my feet are now fast
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
She seems too far out
You don't forget
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Ain't it hard when you discover that
We can hold up a toast if we meet
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
There's some people that
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
Johnny's in the basement
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
He built a fire on Main Street
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
I just might have to come see you
I'll remember you
To be alone with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
And I tell this truth to you
To protect you and defend you
I can be just like you
It's just crazy being here with you
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
He been living there three years now
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
It only goes to show
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Sooner or later one of us must know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
I'd sure like to know
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Don't it always a-go to show
Well, I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Don't it always go to show
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
The only one I know
But sooner or later one of us must know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
She puts it to me plain as day
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Well, I saw it advertised one day
The same thing I would want today
My mind weaves a symphony
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
So, I'm walking down your highway
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
If I don't take the chance to try
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
But I wish there was something you would do or say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Don't you tell Henry
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
I did not do it harmfully
For them that think death––death's honesty
And the ladies treat me kindly
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
She knocked upon it anyway
Maggie says that many say
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
She smiles, walks the other way
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
My ears hear a symphony
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
Though I'd never say
And I'm leaving every day to run away
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
We banged the drum slowly
And for His love they took His life away
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
A cock is crowing far away
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
For them that think death's honesty
For them that must obey authority
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
That I done it the way
To those condemned to act accordingly
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Someone to get you flowers constantly
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
I send you all my money
Spouted out that liberty
The Spanish-American War had its day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
So they took him to the infirmary
And it's up to you to say
No, you'll not now or no other day
From phony jealousy
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
But you can never steal away
That I was just a puppet in a play
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
So I run down most hurriedly
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
But I can't deny
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
She starts to speak, but he walks away
And the only tune my guitar could play
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Went to the doctor the very next day
Or if you just want some company
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Whispering your secret emotion –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Hava–na–
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
With no other choice except but for to go –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Remember me to one who lives there –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Oh, my–
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Havana–gee–
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
With notions his canoe was laden –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Ten thousand miles or more –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Ha–va–
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
That can win what's a-never been won –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
I long to hold you in the night –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Leave all the children home –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
You will not hear a laugh –
Havanagee–luh–
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Disconnect these cables––
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I got no idea what I want –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
First degree and second degree –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Indians camp along her border –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
I'm sure it was not three –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Private reasons – great or small –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
Hang out the whole next day –
To know where you are –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
How badly they were shocked –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
I a-hope you can hear––
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
I hope that you can hear––
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
