Well, I need a woman, alright!
Alright, now!
She's insane!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!

But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!

"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!

I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Goodnight!
Oh!
I figured they was in my TV set!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Take me down to California, baby!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Well!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
Alright!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
It was the mailman!
I got the freight train blues!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Oh, yeah!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
You must think I'm crazy!
I've got the freight train blues!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, no!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Lordy, Lord!
Good God!
I've got a million friends!
How they ever flood my soul!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
And pretend that you never have met."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
They look as dark as night."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
And have it on Highway 61."
You can't blame me at all."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Tangled up in blue."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Come flowing down so free?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Where you and I will unite."
And hung on a willow tree."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
That you must always first forgive them."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You can't blame us at all."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
And punched my cigarette."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
I didn't see you around."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Have it on Highway 61."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
For that reason I will have to stay."
He said, "Tell me about it."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Will mourn for your return."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Country'll grow."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
You must know about my debutante."
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
I'll bring back my lady."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
So write to her tenderly."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
They look as white as snow."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Would kill a little bird like me."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
"I've had too much of your company,"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
We'll both go off together."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
"Is it easy to forget?"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
I can't find my knees."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
I'll see her soon, I know."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
And keep him good company."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
We'll both go home together."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
I'll endow them onto thee."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
"That way down Highway 61."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
We want folksingers here."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
God said, "On Highway 61."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
But we were tangled up in blue."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
It's all for the love of thee."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I would want again tomorrow."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
I love far better than thee."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
Has kindly assisted me home."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
And it's all for the love of thee."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
But I know what you want."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
You and I'll never know."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Well, I been gambling so long,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
I'm pledging my time to you,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
God knows that, when you see it,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
It was a girl I learned it from,
When she lays upon the grass,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Where the neon madmen climb,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
All the silver, all the gold,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Like as not, it's better so,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
God knows there's a purpose,
Ye shall be a-changed,
I got a wife and five little children,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
They say every man need protection,
You got something I want plenty of,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
You can run down to the desert,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Day you quit me, baby,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Name of Martin Luther King,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
God knows it's a struggle,
I thank the Lord,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
So I got those worries blues,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Why she did go,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
As human gods aim for their mark,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
The sky too is folding under you,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
They say every man needs protection,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
You need something to open up a new door,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Looking for a new fool,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Someone to open each and every door,
My existence led by confusion boats,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
God don't call it treason,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Private reasons, great or small,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
I got those worried blues,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
I'm never, never far from home,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
I got two white horses following me,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
All that and more and then some,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
The one we can see and can feel,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Hazel, you called and I came,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Trouble,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
New morning,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
May you stay forever young,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Thieving in the alley,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
And I will not carry myself down to die,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
So, never leave me lonely,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
I wish I a-was a magician,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
I been riding the midnight train,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
You can hear them tires squeal,
I went down where the vultures feed,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
You have given all there is to give,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Don't matter what you did,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
God knows there's a river,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
They say every distance is not near,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
That fired the gun,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Like a complete unknown,
I never can go because, you know,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
I got no place left to turn,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
She once was a true love of mine,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
To strict party-platform ties,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
In the instant that I preach,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Yes, and I'll go last,
One by one they followed the sun,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And not going through any great extreme,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
To a solid rock,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
They say every man must fall,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
I rambled out of New York town,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Madams light the candles,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
I just don't see why I should even care,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
To your tambourine in time,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Tell her not to worry,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
But I know that he don't talk,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Three angels up above the street,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Is it really any wonder,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
I landed up on the downtown side,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
A question in your nerves is lit,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Just don't know what to do,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
She leave by the other and roam,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
My arms and legs were broken,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
She never does me wrong,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
You're beautiful beyond words,
As the present now will later be past,
We live and we die, we know not why,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
A complete unknown,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
True love, they've been without it,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
You say my kisses are not like his,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
A man named Martin Luther King,
I went out last night to take a little round,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
How does it feel,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
But I'm pressing on,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Better jump down a manhole,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
My hands can't feel to grip,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
You wanna drown love,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Makes no difference where she's been,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
You got something better,
See her in that very tight skirt,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
And it's like I ain't here,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
They run a brick and tile company,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Seem like I been down this way before,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
And all of your children start to resent you,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Had no one to go my bail,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
To hide 'neath a hood,
If not for you,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
So glad,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
I can't be good, baby,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
And there's two white horses following me,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
The night blows cold and rainy,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
You got to serve somebody,
Want you so bad,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
God knows it's true,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
More people kept a-piling on,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
God knows everything,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Paradise, sacrifice,
It was you who came right through,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Thank You, Lord,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Said I'm pressing on,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
That you'd have liked me to,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Simplify you, classify you,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
The night would see me wide awake,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Don't mind the driving rain,
If you'd see me this way,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
That can do what's never been done,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
In the hills of mystery,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
God knows it's a crime,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Yet every distance is not near,
Puffing on a big cigar,
One by one they follow the sun,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Silhouetted by the sea,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
You follow, find yourself at war,
As his youth now unfolds,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
And, on their promises of paradise,
I had so much left to do,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
And give him back the time he's done,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
God knows it's terrifying,
Well, I gave you all my money,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
I don't wanna fake you out,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
China doll, alcohol,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Well, get sick, get well,
Is used, it is plain,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Oh, see what you can do,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
He won't do nothing to you,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Corrina, Corrina,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
People talk over situations,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
If anything is gonna sell,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
When there is no more,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Better jump down the manhole,
I should have left this town this morning,
No direction home,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Every moon is so sanctified,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Of this I can't say very much,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Father of loneliness and pain,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
I had no one for to go my bail,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
And you take just like a woman,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Far away in the stormy night,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Seven days,
Want you,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Love that's pure no accident,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Don't let me change my heart,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
It's rising up above my head,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
I got a bird that whistles,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Honey, just for you to climb,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Get back, write Braille,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
I've been in and out of happiness,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
One more night the stars are in sight,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
And, if I see the day,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Every nerve is analyzed,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I'd only have to stay,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
I'll go see them come down my way,
That fellow who never blushes,
The joint is jumping,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
And gathering storms may arise,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
That the laws are with him,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Now, won't you tell me true,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
But you were gambling for support,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
I've been around this whole country,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
And, although that we're single and free,
Tell me that you love me only,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Going, going, gone,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
I think we better talk this over,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Bringing me all of your charms,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
You have given me life to live,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Watch the river flow,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
To be so useless and all,
Try hard, get barred,
Where life and death are memorized,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Out to the windy beach,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Just then the order came to charge,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
But you try with your whole soul,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
They must bust in early May,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Thinking about the government,
With the juice running down my leg,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Keep a clean nose,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Stripping away at it all,
Every head is so dignified,
The day you quit me, baby,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
And it ain't me, babe,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
And they––they look at me and frown,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
By rivers of blindness,
He's not selling any alibis,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Someone to close his heart,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
The man in the trench-coat,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I want my arms around you,
With his candle lit into the sun,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
And furnish me with tape,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
You and me, we had completeness,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Oh, in somebody's room,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
One by one until there were none,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
I can finish this alone, honey,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
In the great unknown,
You had enough of hatred,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Don't you tell Henry,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
You need something to open your eyes,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Father of black, father of white,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Judge and jury took their stand,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
People are crazy, times are strange,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
All the tired horses in the sun,
God knows it's outta sight,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
They lowered him down as a king,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Eh, singing just for you,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Oh, watered-down love,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
We live in a political world,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Friends with you,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
To be on your own,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Wasn't making any great connection,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
To know how much I really care,
But the time ain't tall,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
As the daylight hours do increase,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Well, I may just swear,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Over your senses you have no control,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Don't try No Doz,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Get jailed, jump bail,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
I'm leaving today,
Or have done something wrong,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
But I'm saved,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Laying low,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
A true love of mine,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Come all without, come all within,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Fare thee well but for a while,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
God don't call it wrong,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Don't tie no bows,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
All them prophets good and gone,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
If I didn't have to guess,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
For the wise men and the fools,
Is looking for a new fool,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
If you'd see me this a-way,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Had a dream about you, baby,
I can make it through,
If'n you don't know by now,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
If you can't quit your sinning,
And may you stay forever young,
First degree and second degree,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Watching the river flow,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
You better duck down the alleyway,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Going,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
And also by his feet,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
You'll change your last name, too,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Honey, I will meet you there,
And the sooner you come up with them,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
It's really something,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
I'd be sad and blue,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You will be alright, girl,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
Without your sweet love,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Newspapermen eating candy,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
There's always someone who understands,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
It still ain't me, babe,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
It always has hit me from below,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
The wind blowing the snow around,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
It hurts me, too,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Hmm, I can make it through,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Circled by the circus sands,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Father of air and father of trees,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
To protect his white skin,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Into my own parade,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
High water rising, rising night and day,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
It could even be like a myth,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Well, well, well,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
That can do what's a-never been done,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
It was from her ship sailing,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Try to be a success,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
And she'll be coming forth,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
God knows there's a heaven,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
I won't have my nature way,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
People carry roses,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Precious father, loving mother,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
And the whole world is on your case,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
I been good while I been waiting,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Made of silver or of golden,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
But evidently she don't,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Without a dream in my heart,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
The beat is pumping,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Silvio, I gotta go,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Every brain is civilized,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
Father of minutes, father of days,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Got me a secret membership card,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
I just keep pressing on,
The sky too is folding over you,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Waiting for the trains,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Who among them would try to impress you,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Till both of us fell by the way,
I tried to reach you, honey,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
God knows it's fragile,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Cares not to come up any higher,
To find out if she's talked,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Make you spin or do you in,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Wintertime in New York town,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
And it's only that I'm asking,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
On this new morning, new morning,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
And your streets are getting empty,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Each one playing a horn,
The kingdoms of experience,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And I got those worried blues,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
Look who's back in town,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
We've killed each one,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
See you fly or watch you die,
Socialism, hypnotism,
I got the worried blues,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
You better chew gum,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
But, if I can save you any time,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Hang around the ink-well,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Read books, repeat quotations,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Mixing up the medicine,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
To be––direction home,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
I threw it all away,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
You have given me eyes to see,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
To be alone with you,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
That one doctor cannot save him,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Icicles hanging down,
Some things are too hot to touch,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
You were striped, you were plain,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
And point away from the past,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
A dream about you, baby,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Give you my money, honey,
Went to the station down in the yard,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
The man there said he loved my sound,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
May be the head of some big TV network,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
He's the property of Jesus,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
You made it there somehow,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
"Not I," said the referee,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Ten thousand men on the move,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Resent him to the bone,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Can't find what I need,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
She'll surely turn to white,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
But, deep inside my heart,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Far away from it all,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
A million faces at my feet,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
He is centuries old,
Heart of mine,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Go melt back in the night,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
They tell me every man must fall,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
How he died nobody can say,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
He's young and on fire,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
To be out on your own,
If she ain't feeling well,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
The train leaves at half past ten,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Too serious to fool,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
To be without a home,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
One summer's day he came passing by,
In love and with kindness,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Searching high, searching low,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
I love you, pretty baby,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Father of night, father of day,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Pressing on,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Winter would have no spring,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Baby, please stop crying,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
With his fist in a clinch,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
You married young just like your ma,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
She'll be coming forth,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
With what your fate is going to be,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
If you must cling to someone,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
She's crying like an evil stone,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
But I will be back, I will survive,
And come every time you call,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
For all intended purposes,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And the point is slick,
My limbs are shaking,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
That, while life's pleasures be few,
To have––be on your own,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Love don't have any place,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Four by four, no illusion for,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Don't let me drift too far,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Where mercy walks the plank,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
That her father was going to hang,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
A hand set the spark,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
And comes to a permanent stop,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Speaking to some French girl,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
They pass by so silently,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
True love of mine,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I wish tonight were here,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Joey, Joey,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
With no direction home,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Relationships of ownership,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Heart of mine, be still,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
For her to arrive,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Already the fiesta has begun,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Light yourself a candle,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Each time we meet, love,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
That five walls cannot hide him,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Bring the wife and family,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
I know I can't win,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
And she aches just like a woman,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Without ideals or violence,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
And I'm in the shade,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
My love, she speaks softly,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
We never much thought we could get very old,
"Come along and take a trip,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
And I got the worried blues,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
He been around the world and back again,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Don't let yourself fall,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
They took a clean-cut kid,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
But something has changed,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Far away and over the wall,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
I shall be released,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
It's not aimed at anyone,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
While paupers change possessions,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Advertising signs, they con,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Yesterday is just a memory,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
But it would not be new,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
And played the fife lowly,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Get born, keep warm,
Carry the New York Times,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Using every angle under the sun,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Oh, singing just for you,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Without a love of my own,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Too noble to neglect,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
He got that soft, silky skin,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Over the hills and far away,
And forget my pride,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
To be one your own,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
I don't care if you analyze me,
In the lonely night,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
She said she would never forget,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
I bless the day I found you,
Dream about you, baby,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
She would have married me,
You even make love just like a woman,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
That must be what it's all about,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Poor boy never say die,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
I once held her in my arms,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
I can't understand,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Just like a rolling stone,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
I can change, I swear,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Oh, Angelina,
They say everything can be replaced,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
I'll be on my way,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
Aim well, my little one,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Or select you or dissect you,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
It's too bad he had to go,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Dust on my face and my cape,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
The air is getting hotter,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
By users, cheaters,
I been good,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
They––they show me to the door,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
The only son of God Almighty,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Where I will always be renewed,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Like a dog on a chain,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
But, if you want me to,
Automobile coming into style,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
All you can do is do what you must,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
First to come in was the flying moth,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
She got great big hind legs,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
A worried man with a worried mind,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
"Not me," said his manager,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Far past the frozen leaves,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
My dear, sweet friend,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
You stole her love from me one day,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
And joined the John Birch Society,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
The path you've endured has been rough,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Grandpa died last week,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Most of the time it's well understood,
To shine in through,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
You'll be doing society a favor,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
It don't matter what you did,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
You have explained every mystery,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
She said she would always stay,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
It's alright,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Don't wanna be a bum,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
She's opened up a happy home,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Don't know what to do without it,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I ain't looking to block you up,
The winter would hold no spring,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
You were snow, you were rain,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
I'd give you the sky high above,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
May be living in another country under another name,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
The Second World War came to an end,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
God knows there's a chance,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Yesterday's just a memory,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
You don't want a love that's pure,
And, if I can save you any time,
For his age he is wise,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Equality, liberty,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
In his anger and his shame,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Memory, ecstasy,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Stand up straight and tall,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
While riding on a train going west,
And, if anybody asks me,
God knows how to make it flow,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Of ancient history,
A foreign sound to your ear,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
For something that he never done,
I got my mind made up,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
Don't let her see,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Like you never did before,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Roll, Willie, roll,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Like some mystery,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
I need a shot of love,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Who could they get to carry you,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Searching everywhere I know,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Going home,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
I try my best to be like I am,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Keep me where you are,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
How many times have you heard someone say,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Everything's a-hers or his,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
But, to remain as friends,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
It's like I ain't here,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Gonna serve somebody,
I have no one to meet,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Go away from my window,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
I want you,
Get dressed, get blessed,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
May be an actor in a plot,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Analyze you, categorize you,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Never did feel this way before,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
This world is ruled by violence,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
God knows you've got to weep,
In the end,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
I just can't beg you anymore,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Take the motherless children off the street,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
And I'm so glad,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
And I'm back in the rain,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Give what I got until I got no more,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
In the darkness of my night,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Front door shut, back door too,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
You to me were true,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Nothing too very scientific,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Strangers all give me the news,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Just like I did before,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
I've been saved – well, alright,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
And on the highway of regret,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
I just don't know what to do,
You want watered-down love,
From their fates try to resign,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
The phone's tapped anyway,
But the bottles are done,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
I just say no thanks,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
The country doctor rambles,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
The day would surely have to break,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I'm going down the river,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Hmm, see what you can do,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
You can raise up your right hand,
I can't cross the line, you know,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Like a rolling stone,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
And, though the line is cut,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
You could look at it and weep,
But ye shall be a-changed,
I'm going out of my mind,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
We'll fly the night away,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Face full of black soot,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Broken hands on broken plows,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I'm so glad,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Well, the job that you used to have,
There she come, now, down my way,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
Since you've been gone,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
And you know I could never be your own,
And to come every time you call,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Well, I can't understand,
The country music station plays soft,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I want you so bad,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
At the close of the day,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
If ever I prove false to you,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
To keep up his hate,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
But I've been hanging on,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And here I sit so patiently,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Mercury, gravity,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Just to know that you are near,
You're beautiful to me,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
On the stone that remains,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
When all will be well,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Went back home to the yard,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Drag you down or drain you down,
But it ain't me, babe,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
I march in the parade of liberty,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
In the ruins of your balcony,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Looking 'bout the government,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Precious angel under the sun,
Poor boy dressed in black,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Up and down the block,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
To hang and to lynch,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Saved,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
In the shadows of moonlight,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
And I don't want to drag you down,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
I can see the turning of the key,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
We take great delight in our own company,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Look out, kid,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Eh, see what you can do,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
Living in the land of Nod,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Don't wear sandals,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
People going down to the ground,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Watered-down love,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Loyalty, unity,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
To stay closer than any friend,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Ye shall be changed,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Come on, come on, stick together,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Ah, get sick, get well,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
They say that every man must fall,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
But, it ain't me, babe,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Got my mind made up,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
In the turning of twilight,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
This situation can only get rougher,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Made before the foundation of the world,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
That foreign sound in your ear,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
Adiós, mi corazón,
I went back home, put on my tie,
God knows you ain't pretty,
The light I never knowed,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Need a woman all the time,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Trust yourself,
You don't have to feed me,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
They walk among the stately trees,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Nothing was delivered,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
How he died nobody could say,
And ride a horse along the trail,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Baby, let me follow you down,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Under the microscope,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Three by three they're turning the key,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
I'm gonna let you pass,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
Precious memories, how they linger,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Badge out, laid off,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Serve somebody,
Well, I'm pressing on,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
I'd already gone the distance,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Stay away from the train line,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Don't let her hear,
And to come each time you call,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Don't follow leaders,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Just remember that death is not the end,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
And think they're fooling you,
I went into the city, into the town,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
For the politician's gain,
It always means so much,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
No, nothing was delivered,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
A thousand miles from home,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Tell me,
People talk of situations,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
God knows when,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
But it ain't him to blame,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
And I'm just like that bird,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
My woman needs it every day,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
You have given everything to me,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Forever young, forever young,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
The night passed away so quickly,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
I'm going back to Colorado,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
When I was in Missouri,
Don't let her know,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
The angels play on their horns all day,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Holding his club like he was a king,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
To gather flowers constantly,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
A man with a badge skips by,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
So unknown,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
The carpet too is moving under you,
In the little church a-this side of town,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Don't ever try to change me,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
My senses have been stripped,
With a killer's pride, security,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Drifting too far from shore,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
When I seen him lose control,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
And I––I walk out on my own,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Well, I'm so glad,
If you throw it all away,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
I get my sweet reward,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
You've got to serve somebody,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
You gotta look some other place,
Going, going,
In one the surface was frozen,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
When the night comes falling,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Ever since I been a child,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
But now morning is clear,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
And you make love just like a woman,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Not the end, not the end,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
I try my best to be just like I am,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Father who build the mountain so high,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
For she ain't the same,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Stone you and say good luck,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Broken switches, broken gates,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
But he can't be blamed,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Never weak, but always strong,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Read books and repeat quotations,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
By losers, cheaters,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Look away, you rolling river,
Vanished from my hand,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Carved next to his name,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I would not feel so all alone,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
But you're doing it again,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Ain't no going back,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
They keep it all hid,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
They say every man must need protection,
Who will promise never to part,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Staying far behind without you,
Six months on the chain gang,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
But, if I will save you the time,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
They don't believe in mercy,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
At ships with tattooed sails,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Father of day, father of night,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
And every cause that ever I fought,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
It's a price I have to pay,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
All I really wanna do,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
You find God in the church of your choice,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
God sees it all unfold,
Go down to the river, babe,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Democracy don't rule the world --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
That's where you belong --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
And the mailbox is locked.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
Humility, simplicity.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
I can't see through it anymore.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Looking for a new friend.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
You got a heart of stone.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
For she once was a true love of mine.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
I been worrying about you, baby.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
Just remember that death is not the end.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
I'm not the one you need.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
You won't get it for money.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
What's real and what is not.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
And try to avoid the scandals.
I just go pump on it some.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
Oh, yes, they did.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
I'm just average, common too.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
For the saving grace that's over me.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Mine alone.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
And I was brought up by my brother.
And I'll go last.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
I froze right to the bone.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
I always thought that he was well.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he'd lightly touch down.
You cast your spell and I went under.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
I'm not that eager to make a mistake.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
When my memory is not so short.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
Without this love that we call ours.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
And they gotta cut something.
No kindred or relative nigh.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Far down the street we stray.
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And relive my dreams.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
I don't know.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
Sound like it's on a final run.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
And the Santa Fe.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
Nobility, humility.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
Tangled up in blue.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
When I run outta things to investigate.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
My love winks, she does not bother.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Or stay all night with thee.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
Adiós, mi corazón.
The light I never knowed.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
They got a parade permit and a police escort.
In an oil refinery.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
But my heart just won't give in.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
It was a normal day.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
You're the only love I've ever known.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
With the golden loom.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Now they say it's the land of money.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
I see that stationmaster too.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you.
New morning.
You're a big girl all the way.
You want a watered-down love.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
I'm falling in love with you.
And pretend that we never have touched.
I got nothing left to burn.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
And make promises by the hours.
It was you who understood.
68, but says she's 24.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
Look a-the other way.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
After losing every battle.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
See that my grave is kept clean.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Honey, I never would have come.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Yes, tell me.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
I did not do it knowingly.
You may not see me tomorrow.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Six by six...
Hmm, tell me.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
As if a wedding vow.
Father of love and father of rain.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
Turned on my record player.
My love, she speaks softly.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
Honey, baby.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
So many people I never saw in my life.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
You always got more than enough rope.
I would only let you down.
Even before you came in the door.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
For as long as love will last.
The whole world is my throne.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
I finally got a job in New York town.
From the little Minnesota town.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Hear me singing through these tears.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
But you're not even sure what it is.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Tell me that it isn't true.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Everybody that was hanging out.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Leave no stone unturned.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Everything is gonna be alright.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
But simply because it's true.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.

And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Chain you down or bring you down.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
Bid farewell forever.
He's only a pawn in their game.
I shall be released.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Finalize you or advertise you.
About an old man that never done wrong.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.

My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.

Then come back and cook up a meal.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
When she's better only time'll tell.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
Buildings going up to the sky.

And clouds cover up the ground.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Mama, take this badge off of me.

All the young men with the young women looking so good.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.

'Bout the shape that he's in.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.

With my suitcase in my hand.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
"And stay all night with me.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
With all these promises you left for me.
Oh, got my mind made up.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.

It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Evidently she won't.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Fighting every inch of the way.
To be alone with you.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
Oh, Angelina.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.

Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
But I ain't neither one.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.

Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
68, but says he's 24.

Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
And I need you, ah.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
That Johanna's not here.
To make me think I'm wrong.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Who says she knows me well.
Or put up against the wall.
Just like so many times before.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
But the mountains of the past.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.

Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
'Steada acting like we never met.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
That last night I was with.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Can't see over to the other side.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Not somebody that you play around with much.

She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
To which a scoundrel clings.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
But I know that I can't move.
I'm a-going where I never been before.

Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
For me to return to or chase.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
It don't matter anyhow.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
That can win what's never been won.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
When I paint my masterpiece.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
And I'll rock you too.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
To know which way the wind blows.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
That's the way I remember her best.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Sweet lady.
You'd better get that in your head.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
And then unto eternity.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
I needed somebody to talk to.
Down along my restless palms.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
I will only let you down.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Well, I'm just thumping.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
In fond memory appear.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
She's in some foreign land.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Said it was a bad dream.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Rain would gather, too.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
She said she would always stay.
Suffering like a fool.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Through the darkness on the pathways of life.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
While I'm in the hall.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
To anything I might've tried.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
From my toes up to my ears.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Mary wore three links of chain.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
And I's left alone with three children.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Lay dead beside him there.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Things will be alright by and by.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Wants to get it paid off.
With an iron chain around his neck.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
I just can't beg you anymore.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
You're on the bottom.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
It only brings me sorrow.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
See like me or be like me.
Join the army if you fail.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
While evening slips away.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Gonna serve somebody.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
The whole night through.
Under the hedges.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Gal, you're on my mind.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Girls like birds fly away.
And then go on home and have my fun.
To kill with no pain.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Feel further away than ever before.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
Greenwich Village.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Never will want for money.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
You're too hot, darling.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
Every link was Jesus's name.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Just to take somebody's money away.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
What some people are gonna do for money.
I'm younger than that now.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Last radio is playing.
Mama, you been on my mind.
When my working day's through.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
What you'll say when you get home.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
I seen a man.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
Some place so high above this wall.
You'll never see me frown.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
If you just let me follow you down.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
It'll never do, somehow.
As the present now will later be past.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
And every window made of glass.
My baby told me I would have to go.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Honey, come and see about me.
He's always on trial for just being born.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.

Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
If I ride back again.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
You're drifting too far from shore.
See him at play makes me smile.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I see better days and I do better things.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
There was nobody around.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
The next day could be your last.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
Go lightly on the ground.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
That's the day you die.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.

It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Saying wants company.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.

Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.

But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Patriotism, materialism.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
I'll only let you down.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Is when I'm alone with you.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
Broken voices on broken phones.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
And ye shall be changed.
That which is not permanent don't last.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
That number eleven was closing.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
You in a marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
And your highway's getting filled.
And it never seemed strange.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
That's really and truly an American.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
Good car to drive, after a war.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Go find out something only dead men know.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
I'd be lost if not for you.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
And come away with me.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
But all I see are dark eyes.
I know something is changed.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
There's no words that need to be said.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Lord, protect my child.
It was all over by a quarter past.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
Carry for you deep down inside.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I can't shoot them anymore.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Living down Sonora way.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
And light on your right knee.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
And all your raging glory.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from Black Diamond Bay.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
In the border-towns of despair.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Rode slowly back again.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Lay your hand upon my head.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
Honey, I want you.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
You know, I loved her just the same.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
Nothing done and nothing said.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
On the caboose of the train.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Under the midnight moon.
Her fond face pale with woe.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
And he was a friend of mine.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
I threw it all away.
The sooner you can leave.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
Up and down the lonesome town.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal.
And I've never been too impressed.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Come on, darling.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
That just struck me kinda funny.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
Going back where we come from.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
But I was raised on the other.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Someone who will die for you and more.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Havanageeluh.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
If not for you.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
While my conscience explodes.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
God knows...
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Going through all these things twice.
Just what this song is all about.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
I took some comfort there.
But I ain't got Corrina.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Of war and peace the truth just twists.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas give her a drum.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty.
Crying out that he was framed.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
I got nothing to go back to now.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
I don't even know why we come.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
That must be what it's all about.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Hope you're ready.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
You only got ten.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
They would not let me be.
You sound like a hillbilly.
The words that her lover had said.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
All because of the color of his skin.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
I had something to protect.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.

And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Come on, honey.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.

For the times, they are a-changing.
But I had to sit in back of the tub.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
I can't fire them anymore.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
The same as my father before him.
And each one I've never seen again.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
It can't be this way everywhere.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.

You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
They found him dead in the street one day.
And wait for succeeding kings.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Trying to create a next world war.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.

Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
Everybody must get stoned.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
I want you.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Come on, baby.
With the glory that is to be.
I just can't keep from crying.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Nobody stops to ask why.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
My mind is breaking.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
May you stay forever young.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.

And I've a-never been too impressed.
Without ideals or violence.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.

And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
I scarcely feel the glow.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
I can't fight them anymore.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
She can't find him anywhere.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
And the morning will be breaking.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
I's looking around just to see myself.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Is it something important? Maybe not.

He's a weird monkey, very funky.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Everything is broken.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
So, darling, you better come through.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.

Make a living by a-putting on airs.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.

But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
A-lord, protect my child.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
To see that you're madly in love.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.

With your golden loom.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Who always was too proud to beg.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
And disregards the rest.
Our chances really was a million to one.
"And light on my right knee.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Going, going, gone.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
I'll remember you.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
All because his face was brown.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
And guarded them as they fell.
With gold and silver in her hand.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
You are on the bottom.

They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
To keep her from the howling winds.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
She acts like we never met.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Epitome, rigidity.
I think this time we should escape.

Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
You can make it too.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
High society, notoriety.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
By that soft and shining sea.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Everything is gonna be fine.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
A true love of mine.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.

I don't know any more than this.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
The last radio is playing.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Don't remember one thing more.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I said that.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
I'd give anything to be with you.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
That brave and devoted band.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
I haven't tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
At the end of the trail.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Life don't mean a thing.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.

I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Orders from the D.A.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I hope you're ready.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
I followed the winding stream.

Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Throw my ticket out the window.

Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Police at your back.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Memories of what used to be.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.

Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Some place so high above the wall.
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Baby, please come home.
Just you and me.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
When I'm alone with you.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
To the old folks' home and the college.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
You're gonna need my help someday.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
I know you always say that you agree.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
In the pale moonlight.
Some speak of the future.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
And no time to think.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
To reach of your rattling drums.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
I can't use it anymore.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Is just equality in school.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
People bending broken rules.
Crying out that he been framed.
I once held her in my arms.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Figuring a way to get back home.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
I know they're not what they seem.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
And rivers that ran through every day.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
If you just let me come home with you.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
You to me were the best.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Dollar a day's worth.
Everything inside is made of stone.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
So quickly into autumn.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
We may not make it through the night.
Is tearing up your mind.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Like you never done before.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
He's got his mother's eyes.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Trust yourself.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Oh, convey herself away.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
I remember her whispering yet.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
You can show me a new place to start.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Bring that bottle over here.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Madams light the candles.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
Waiting on my burying ground.
Precious memories flood my soul.
That set everybody free.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
I didn't feel so cold then.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
Valentines can't buy her.
The sooner you can go.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
You break your promise all over the place.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Duality, mortality.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
And tapestry of rhyme.
Now and forever let it be me.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
When he played and we didn't dance.
And get something quick to eat.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
You're my baby.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
The night will soon be gone.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Tried to create a next world war.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Take it on down to give me grow.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
Or inspect you or reject you.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
She pretends like we never have met.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
The National Guard stands around his door.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Is gonna be against the law.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
They don't make nothing here no more.
Tell me.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
You can't win with a losing hand.

Just crying out that he was framed.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Man is opposed to fair play:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
But there's one promise, darling:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
His epitaph plain:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Till I come into New York town:
Yeah, serve somebody:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Serve somebody:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
I find complete love;
Make promises by the hour;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Had to be held down by big police;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Some speak of the future;
All lies and jest;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Crumble into one another;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Everybody that was hanging out;
So many things that we never will undo;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
About everybody that was hanging out;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>Thank––</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>

<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>

<i>Ready, George?</i>

<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
<p>
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
The love that a stranger might receive?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Where did you lose your wings?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Before he can see the sky?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Before he can hear people cry?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Must everybody bow?
Is it rolling, Bob?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
For all these earthly things?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Don't you remember making baby love?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
How could they let you go?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Before they're forever banned?
I seen better times, but who has not?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Am I still dreaming yet?
When he's standing in front of you?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Oh, so why not you and me?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
What do you think about that, my friend?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Before you call him a man?
When did you leave heaven?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
How does it feel?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Can you get back in?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
How much poison did they inhale?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Have they missed you?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
And how does it feel?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Baby, can I come home with you?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
How many more without any reward?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
How can I live for You?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Why would I want to take your life?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Just like a rolling stone?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
How could they ever mistake you?
Are you the same person that was here before?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And one deserving of affection?
Does he change the course of rivers?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Why and what's the reason for?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
Poor boy, where you been?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
What else can a poor boy do?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
But am I still dreaming yet?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
How many compared to yesterday?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Of everything you see?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
What can I do for You?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
How can you say he will haunt you?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
How come you don't send me no regards?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Baby, can't you tell?
Does anyone even try?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
How many more can they afford?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
How's everything in heaven?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Has anybody seen my love?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
By golly, what more can I say?
What good am I?
Who killed Davey Moore?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Across the swooping plain?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
To love and follow His direction?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Across the swamp of time?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can I come home with you?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Before they're allowed to be free?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Gal, where you been so long?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
How many paths did they try and fail?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Where did you hide your halo?
What's wrong with you this time?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
What would life be?
Like a rolling stone?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Am I ready?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
That too many people have died?
What can I give to You?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Are you ready?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Too many people have died?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
You have to pay to get outta
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And those whom doom and death had spared
Maybe someday you will understand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
Things would be different the next time we wed
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
And things would be different the next time we wed
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
I run right home and I went to bed
By no special friend
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
It's something you did
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
You used to be so amused
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
She let go of my hand
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
I had to say something to strike him very weird
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
And your trouble is you know it too good
I've been walking around
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
To see him obviously framed
But all that suffering was not to be compared
How many times can a man turn his head
We live in a political world
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Silvio, silver and gold
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
As I stand upon the sand
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Now you don't seem so proud
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Nothing was delivered
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
Now, whenever I get up and
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Everything stays down where it's wounded
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
He wagged his tail and shook his head
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
"Equality". I spoke the word
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
All the sweethearts you can hold
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
I want you, baby, just to understand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
There ain't nothing in this world
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
But she ain't gonna find the road
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I'll always thank the Lord
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
You try so hard, but you don't understand
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
But now something has changed
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
You used––be so proud
So I'll make my stand
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Its iron claws attached
Then came the warning that was before the flood
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
While some, on principles baptized
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
They took a clean-cut kid
And into the path you are hurled
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
The changes I was going through can't even be used
But something has changed
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
And then you told me later as I apologized
Now you don't act so––so proud
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, a very great man once said
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
I thought that it was well-understood
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Somebody seen him hanging around
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Many times I've often prayed
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
For what you sold that's not been received
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
I live in another world
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
He was a clean-cut kid
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Either from the mountains of Madrid
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
I will not go down under the ground
Just what you had in mind
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
She been gone
Just pick anyone
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
And suddenly there appeared before me
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Mona tried to tell me
Lies that life is black-and-white
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
How many ears must one man have
And that is that one must always flush out his house
On the rising curve
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
You cut to the core
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
And you see why it's so unique to be
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
You could almost think that you're seeing double
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
I been wondering all about me
And I would send a message
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
There were times when I was so lonesome
How was I to know you'd be the one
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
What good am I then to others and me
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Taking care of somebody nice
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
And I'm just the same as anyone else
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
I am homeless, come and take me
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
It's getting dark, too dark to see
While them that defend what they cannot see
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Looking at hands for the lines that were
The cause was there before we came
Most of the time I can't even be sure
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
He'll see by his grave
Better stay away from those
They say don't come back no more
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
You're not free to belong to me
It's all new to me
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
From all the plans they do pursue
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
When Reilly's daughter got a message
When the rain is blowing in your face
You just pick anyone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
I do declare
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Well, it's all new to me
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Up into some paradise
If dogs run free, then what must be
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
So I look like a walking mountain range
But it won't be over till they clear his name
"It's only you that he does crave
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
You say you're looking for someone
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
At dawn my lover comes to me
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
The crashing waves roll over me
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
And her silver-studded phantom cause
What you're gonna say when you get home
All I feel is heat and flame
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
I can survive and I can endure
When I'm all alone
You know, it's not even safe no more
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Well, six white horses that you did promise
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
I rode with him in a taxi once
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
We see this empty cage now corrode
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
See the primitive wallflower freeze
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Breaking hearts up and down the line
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
To give the special one you seek a chance
Though its shadow's metal badge
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
That she's the same one
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
To show you something you seen before
Remember me to the one who lives there
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
You into thinking you're the one
A girl who would murder her own, true love
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
But I can get another one
Full of hope and desire
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
What about that millionaire
What's probably got you baffled more
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
A bed that is never mine
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
If dogs run free, why not we
Limited in sex they dare
But I feel nothing for their game
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
You smiling through the fence at me
I don't even notice she gone
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
So I remember every face
Little did I realize
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Among the lovely people living free
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Remember me to one who lives there
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
So up she picked her babies three
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
You said you'd never compromise
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Says it's closing time
But I can't say I sympathize
If dogs run free, why not me
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
And the Negro's name
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
When the roses fade
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
And plenty time for good romance
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Hunger pays a heavy price
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
With all memory and fate
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
She plunged him into well water where
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
Should I put them by your gate
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
So, I called up the operator of time
"Oh, father, you will surely die
And I ain't complaining none
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
But the dark does die
Con you into thinking that you're the one
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Waiting to find out what price
Knows there's no success like failure
It'll be with me unto the grave
And never sat once at the head of the table
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
From the start by the rule
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
As he rises to fame
The man the authorities came to blame
She knows there's no success like failure
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
I'm ready for to fade
Should I leave them by your gate
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Just what you will say when you get home
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
Trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
For your weary toes to be touching
The battle outside raging
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
I know that you know that I know that you show something
'Cause the battle outside raging
And the cards are no good that you're holding
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
What am I saying? What am I knowing
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
It's not a bad way to make a living
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
If I was with her too long
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Beyond here lies nothing
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
The order is a-rapidly fading
They're drinking up and walking
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
The order is rapidly fading
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
She rode by night and came by morning
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
I can hear their hearts a-beating
But then a whistle will be blowing
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
And there's no telling who that it's naming
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Deceived me into thinking
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
Where the time and the tempo drag
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
There's nothing in here moving
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
Look out, the saints are coming through
Then she told us how times were tough
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Girls' faces formed the forward path
And how I know I'll make it through
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I have fallen far beneath
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
The man in me will do nearly any task
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
Shoot in the back
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Well, there ain't no going back
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
I wish she'd unlock
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
But they caught him and they brought him back
You turn around to take a final peek
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Her voice once and talk
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Well, if I die on top of the hill
They ask me how I feel
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
And if my love is real
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
How many seas must the white dove sail
But among the dead that were left on the hill
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
All and all can only fall
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
How does it feel
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Ring bell, hard to tell
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
A girl by the whirlpool
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
I chased me a woman up the hill
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Then why don't she tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
A-how does it feel
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Soul to soul our shadows roll
He's taught in his school
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Oh, how does it feel
How many seas must a white dove sail
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
He's sure got a lot of gall
Ring bar, hard to tell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Muttering small talk at the wall
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
"For you cannot relive them
Two eyes took the aim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
And remain as I am
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
You better not chew gum
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
But I can hear another drum
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
For the loser now will be later to win
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
You don't need a weatherman
From heights that they could not gain
As you sit on the box you keep him in
To my knowledge there's just one man
And all their daughters put me down
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
That long, black train is pulling on down
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
There was little to say, there was no conversation
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
"Not me," said the gambling man
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Suicide remarks are torn
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
That long, black train is pulling down
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Trying to get a lead on
Uncle Rat went running downtown
How can the life of such a man
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
But all their daughters put me down
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Must meet the dawn
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Have died in battle or in vain
Guns and clubs followed him down
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
And the smell of their roses does not remain
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
She said that all the railroad men
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
My love, she's like some raven
And there's no exit in any direction
Their religion of the little ten women
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
And the corner sign
And she wakes just like a woman
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
You need something to make it known
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
But the second mom was with the seventh son
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Nothing we can call our own
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
I'll be waiting at the station
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
For the loser now might be later to win
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Darkness at the break of noon
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Out of the shower comes a football man
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
How many roads must a man walk down
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And she aches just like a woman
Why did you trade heaven
He got that fortress on the mountain
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Advertising signs that con
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
She takes just like a woman
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
And you ache a-just like a woman
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Somebody new to beat on
But it's hard to think on
But the second mother was with the seventh son
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Well, I'm hanging on
Yes, and someone must explain
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
In the pigpen
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
But me, I expected it to happen
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
The ones that jump on the wagon
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
To remember the times when I was your only man
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
A-she takes just like a woman
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
I figure maybe we're even
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Well, you fake just like a woman
But I swear I see my reflection
But the post office has been stolen
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
She got such a sweet disposition
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
All lay down their bandanas and complain
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
All their daughters put me down
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
You take just like a woman
The next morning she had awoken
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
The very last thing that I'd want to do
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
There's nothing you can say or do
All I really wanna do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
It's very nice to stay a week or two
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Silvio, I gotta go
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
All I'd like you to do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Every place I wanna go
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Man in the coon-skin cap
The man in the coon-skin cap
I walked down there and ended up
How many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
What good am I while you softly weep
Aladdin and his lamp
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
All you boys better run for cover
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Who came here from Cuba's door
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
I don't have to go far
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Still I say her love-words over
Never no more do I wonder
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
At any moment you could go under
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Still I've always kind of missed her
When you whispered in my ear
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
I say, "Why you say that for
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
The wind howls like a hammer
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
The lover who has just walked out your door
But morning is clear
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
So, don't fear if you hear
For I am married to a house carpenter
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
I could feel a whole lot better
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
You heard me saying a prayer for
I close my eyes and I wonder
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
And I don't even think about her
When only you are near
The face of God will appear
My ship is in the harbor
Alone you stand with nobody near
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
She took him by his long, yellow hair
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
In one I was running and in another
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
For all eternity I think I will remember
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
"Not me," said the man whose fists
They whisper in the wings
I'm gonna let you pass
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
In the dimestores and bus-stations
You can fall down on your knees
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
And, though the masters make the rules
Girl by the whirlpool's
Glide across the lonely years
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
People carry roses
You should be made to wear earphones
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
But, though the masters make the rules
What good am I if I say foolish things
Romantic facts of musketeers
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And tells me of her dreams
The empty-handed painter from your streets
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Statues made of matchsticks
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And so Patty calls the cops
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
People on the platforms
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
When your mother sends back all your invitations
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
At times I think there are no words
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
Seven days
Six-time losers
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
I was thinking of a series of dreams
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Don't wear sandals
But still remains
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
And inside it with the people made of molasses
And the princess and the prince discuss
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
As friends and other strangers
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Now, you must provide some answers
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
The cowboy angel rides
Mama, you know, awaits the news
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
You never turned around to see the frowns
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
We living in times when men commit crimes
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
And your father, to your sister he explains
And then complains
You know that he has no intentions
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
And I try to harmonize with songs
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
With a fantastic collection of stamps
You been hurt so many times
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
To sharpen the senses
Thinking of a series of dreams
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
I try to tell it like it is
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Good and bad, I define these terms
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
With a big bouquet of the roses
And the poor white remains
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Don't follow leaders
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
To the cutting of fences
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
Well, the ragman draws circles
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
True love can make a blade of grass
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Wants eleven dollar bills
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Her window's wide open, African trees
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
He's not selling any alibis
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
That it's you and no one else that owns
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
I'd gladly confess
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Six-time users
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
To memorizing politics
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
The slowest now will later be fast
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
He really wasn't where it's at
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
He built a fire on Main Street
Keep me set apart
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
She seems too far out
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
And the first one now will later be last
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
You used to laugh–make fun about
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
You used to laugh about
Someday, everything is gonna be different
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
Wait for the morning light
You're gonna get hit
But, then again, there's only one I've met
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Oh, everybody's got to eat
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
How many years can some people exist
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
There's some people that
Without any doubt
By the way, that's a cute hat
They tell me to be discreet
And, since my feet are now fast
Everyone still talks about
So he never thinks straight
I'm on the pavement
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
It don't take too long to find out
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
You don't forget
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
I'm moving after midnight
How many years can a mountain exist
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Johnny's in the basement
To hold each other tight
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
The slow one now will later be fast
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
That might be all that you got
One more night I will wait for the light
Our Father would not like the way that you act
You're hearing my heart beat
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
I got into the driver's seat
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
They tell me revenge is sweet
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
With your pockets well protected at last
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
In the precious winds they rot
Plants in the bed, but
One more night the moon is shining bright
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Ain't it hard when you discover that
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
I soon get some rest
And I, in my armor, turning about
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
You are there in the flickering light
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
In the stillness of the midnight
But, if the arrow is straight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
To keep it in your mind and not forget
I think that it's best
Everything is always right
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Talking that the heat put
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
I just might have to come see you
I can be just like you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I'll remember you
And I tell this truth to you
To be alone with you
It's just crazy being here with you
To protect you and defend you
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
With only you in view
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Yes, I'd sure like to know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Don't it always go to show
Don't it always a-go to show
I'd sure like to know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
The only one I know
Well, I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
But sooner or later one of us must know
Down every street there's a window
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Sooner or later one of us must know
It only goes to show
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He been living there three years now
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
She knocked upon it anyway
My ears hear a symphony
And it's up to you to say
She puts it to me plain as day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
I did not do it harmfully
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
If I don't take the chance to try
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
No, you'll not now or no other day
But I can't deny
Is worth more than I could pay
So they took him to the infirmary
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Maggie says that many say
And for His love they took His life away
Or if you just want some company
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
But I wish there was something you would do or say
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Don't you tell Henry
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
She smiles, walks the other way
That I was just a puppet in a play
But you can never steal away
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
To those condemned to act accordingly
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
For them that must obey authority
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
She starts to speak, but he walks away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
And that which you've given me today
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
So I run down most hurriedly
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Someone to get you flowers constantly
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Went to the doctor the very next day
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
I send you all my money
We banged the drum slowly
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
And the only tune my guitar could play
For them that think death––death's honesty
Spouted out that liberty
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
And I'm leaving every day to run away
The same thing I would want today
My mind weaves a symphony
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
For them that think death's honesty
A cock is crowing far away
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
The Spanish-American War had its day
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
From phony jealousy
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Though I'd never say
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
He made the bells of freedom ring today
So, I'm walking down your highway
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
That I done it the way
Well, I saw it advertised one day
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And the ladies treat me kindly
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Turn, turn, turn again –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Leave all the children home –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
Indians camp along her border –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
It can't be this way everywhere –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Disconnect these cables––
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Haven't seen her since that night –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
How badly they were shocked –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Havanagee–luh–
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Havana–gee–
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Hang out the whole next day –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
First degree and second degree –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Whispering your secret emotion –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
Ha–va–
I hope that you can hear––
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
As suicide remarks are torn –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Private reasons – great or small –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Hava–na–
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
I got no idea what I want –
I'm sure it was not three –
Oh, my–
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
I a-hope you can hear––
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Remember me to one who lives there –
You will not hear a laugh –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
That can win what's a-never been won –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
I long to hold you in the night –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
To know where you are –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
