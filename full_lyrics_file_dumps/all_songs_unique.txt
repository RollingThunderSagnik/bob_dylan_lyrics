Looking for my lo and behold!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Dignity never been photographed!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!

And then the tears roll down - what a bitter taste!

He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
It was the mailman!

You make love just like a woman - yes, you do!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
I'm in love with you!
She makes love just like a woman - yes, she does!
He punched me out!
Woo!
They got away!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Alright!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
They talk about a life of brotherly love - show me someone who knows how to live it!
She takes just like a woman - yes!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Thank you!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues - oh, well!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Oh, no!
Start over!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts - watch out he don't fall on you!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
You're a liar!
They was all over!
She takes just like a woman - yes, she does!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!

Get me outta here, my dear man!
You fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
Well!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
I ain't different than anyone!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Ah, you fake just like a woman - yes, you do!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!

Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Good God!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!

Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
How they ever flood my soul!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last - oh, yes, I am!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Hootenanny television!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Pressing on - oh, yes, I am!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Alright, now!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
My God, they killed Him!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
She's insane!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Howdy, East Orange!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Woo-hoo!
Yeah, man!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Them Reds did it!

Pressing on - yeah, leading the way!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
You must think I'm crazy!

Goodnight!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Betty Ross!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
Oh, yeah!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
I got the freight train blues!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Play fucking loud!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Take me down to California, baby!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last - oh!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
"Is it easy to forget?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
I can't find my knees."
I would want again tomorrow."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
And say, "Do--would you like to--come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
For that reason I will have to stay."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep - "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
There's just as much foot in--danger in a football game,"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you-you do what you gotta do."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Where you and I will unite."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
"My complexion," she said, " - much too white."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Come flowing down so free?"
We want folksingers here."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
This is ca--this is called "Yes-" - this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Have it on Highway 61."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
You can't blame us at all."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
You and I'll never know."
"How good-how good does it feel to be free?"
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
Next time you see me coming you better run."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you - or haven't you looked?"
We'll both go off together."
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Tangled up in blue."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And punched my cigarette."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
I love far better than thee."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
And hung on a willow tree."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
But I know what you want."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big - "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
And keep him good company."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man - I got to run!"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
You hand in a back door to go--"Is this--this where it is?"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
You can't blame me at all."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
I'll bring back my lady."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
And pretend that you never have met."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how - "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my debutante."
Will mourn for your return."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
He -- "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Country'll grow."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair - "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
We'll both go home together."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
From across that lonesome ocean."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him - he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
But we were tangled up in blue."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Remember the night you lay--blowed little Sadie down?"
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
I didn't see you around."
You must know about my debutante."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
So write to her tenderly."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
I'll endow them onto thee."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
When nothing you got is US-made?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Would kill a little bird like me."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
They look as dark as night."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
And have it on Highway 61."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"Death to all those that--who would whimper and cry!"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull - "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
I'll see her soon, I know."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
God said, "On Highway 61."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Brighton girls are like the moon."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
And she says, "Your debutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
And it's all for the love of thee."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Has kindly assisted me home."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
That you must always first forgive them."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
They look as white as snow."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
"That way down Highway 61."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
It's all for the love of thee."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
I'll apply them all to thee."
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
If you'd see me this a-way,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
That they do not respect in any degree,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
And I--I don't mind the pain,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
China doll, alcohol,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
I need a shot of love,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
No direction home,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
And you make love just like a woman,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
For the wise men and the fools,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
As the daylight hours do increase,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
Carry the New York Times,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Now, won't you tell me true,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Mercury, gravity,
Well, I don't mind dying,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Wintertime in New York town,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
They say every distance is not near,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Living in the land of Nod,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
Over your senses you have no control,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
You have given me eyes to see,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
If ever I prove false to you,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
In the great unknown,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
I'm going out of my mind,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Don't you tell Henry,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
The one we can see and can feel,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
They say that every man must fall,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
When you think that you've lost everything,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
But it ain't me, babe,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Made before the foundation of--of the world,
But ye shall be a-changed,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
Don't let her see,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
That must be what it's all about,
People carry roses,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
I'd already gone the distance,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
The haunted, frightened trees,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Is looking for a new fool,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Father of black, father of white,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
You were striped, you were plain,
Yeah, and--well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
But, it ain't me, babe,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
I can see the turning of the key,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
The Communists was a-coming around,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Is it really any wonder,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
I shall be released,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Makes no difference where she's been,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Going to Ac--to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
And it ain't me, babe,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
I try my best to be just like I am,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Why she did go,
He been around the world and back again,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Or select you or dissect you,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Stripping away at it all,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Far away and over the wall,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
For his age he is wise,
And to come every time you call,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
I'd give you the sky high above,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I love you, pretty baby,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Whoa! and--well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Walking-walking with you in my head,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
And, if anybody asks me,
We live in a political world,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Yet every distance is not near,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Look away, you rolling river,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Senor, Senor, can you tell me where we're heading,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
"Not I," said the referee,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
To protect his white skin,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Just remember that death is not the end,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
And think they're fooling you,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
They say everything can be replaced,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Don't let her know,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Without ideals or violence,
It don't matter what you did,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Agarrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
And I--I walk out on my own,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
And joined the John Birch Society,
They pass by so silently,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
To strict party-platform ties,
And here I sit so patiently,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
My comrades, they all loved me well - a jolly, saucy crew,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
To be--direction home,
He's not selling any alibis,
And she makes love just like a woman,
You came down on me like white thunder,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
I been riding the midnight train,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
They walk among the stately trees,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
If'n you don't know by now,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
You better duck down the alleyway,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
I'm never, never far from home,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
You made it there somehow,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
In one the surface was frozen,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Vanished from my hand,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Where I will always be renewed,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
I just say no thanks,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
It's really something,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
I wish tonight were here,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Since you've been gone,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
I got the worried blues,
Relationships of ownership,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
You say you love me with what be--may be love,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
The country doctor rambles,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
If today was not a crooked highway,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Don't wanna be a bum,
You will be alright, girl,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
God knows there's a chance,
You'll change your last name, too,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Like a complete unknown,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
You got something I want plenty of,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
How he died nobody could say,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait",
A thousand miles from home,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
I get my sweet reward,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
God knows it's terrifying,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined - all except for you,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
It was from her ship sailing,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
My love, she speaks softly,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Make you spin or do you in,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
When all will be well,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Oh, see what you can do,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Going, going,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
God sees it all unfold,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
And come every time you call,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
If you can't quit your sinning,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Holding his club like he was a king,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
To stay closer than any friend,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
But it ain't him to blame,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
And give him back the time he's done,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Without a love of my own,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
I had a dream about you, baby,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Just as long as you stay with me,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
I march in the parade of liberty,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Each one playing a horn,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Well, you know--even before I learned her name,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
The winter would hold no spring,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
A man named Martin Luther King,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
If I didn't have to guess,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Well, I'm pressing on,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
I met a young girl - she gave me a rainbow,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Says he's got a bad bill,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Ever since I been a child,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
But he can't be blamed,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Newspapermen eating candy,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Eh, in somebody's room,
Got me a secret membership card,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
And also by his feet,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
I believe in you when winter turns--turns to summer,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
And, if I can save you any time,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
You have given me life to live,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
But I've been hanging on,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Broken hands on broken plows,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
All that and more and then some,
See you fly or watch you die,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
And you know I could never be your own,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Don't need a shot of turpentine - only bring me to my knees,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
She said she would always stay,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
You broke a heart that loved you,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
A dream about you, baby,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
But you were gambling for support,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
In the lonely night,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
With a killer's pride, security,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Love don't have any place,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
You gotta look some other place,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
I'm pledging my time to you,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
My woman's never sitting at home,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
From their fates try to resign,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Don't mind the driving rain,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Watching the river flow,
But he's the property of Jesus,
"Not me," said his manager,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Some things are too hot to touch,
But I would not feel so all alone,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Is used, it is plain,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
God knows there's a heaven,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Never needed to call you my whore,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
I'd be sad and blue,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Don't let her hear,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
I'm so glad,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and--and he asked me my name,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Papa writes to Johnny - Johnny can't come home,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Icicles hanging down,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Watered-down love,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Memory, ecstasy,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
I can't be good, baby,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true--you gotta follow your heart,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
I know I can't win,
True love, they've been without it,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Well, get sick, get well,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Be careful not to touch the wall - there's a brand-new coat of paint,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
I should have left this town this morning,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know -,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
She said she would never forget,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
With his fist in a clinch,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Go down to the river, babe,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo-lo-love you",
Far away where the soft winds blow,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
I got no place left to turn,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Oh, watered-down love,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
And you're tired trying to get out of - of situations,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I am over you,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
The answer is blowing in the wind,
One by one until there were none,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Look who's back in town,
But it would not be new,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
If your time to you is worth saving,
I want you,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
Well, well, well,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
He's the property of Jesus,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Carved next to his name,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
God knows you've got to weep,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Eh, singing just for you,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
While paupers change possessions,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
The night would see me wide awake,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
Three angels up above the street,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Gonna serve somebody,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
This situation can only get rougher,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Silvio, I gotta go,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
At your feet - at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
When there is no more,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Honey, I will meet you there,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Mixing up the medicine,
Serve somebody,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
I can't cross the line, you know,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
To hang and to lynch,
For she ain't the same,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
A true love of mine,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Simplify you, classify you,
Pressing on - well, I can't turn 'round,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
King of the streets, child of clay,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
All I really wanna do,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
It's alright,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
May be the head of some big TV network,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
But, if I will save you the time,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Never did feel this way before,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
You to me were true,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
God knows when,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
May be living in another country under another name,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
The man there said he loved my sound,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
God knows it's outta sight,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Drifting too far from shore,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Everybody moving - if they ain't already there,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
I thank the Lord,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Well, I gave you all my money,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Loyalty, unity,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Don't matter what you did,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
You don't have to feed me,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
They don't believe in mercy,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
That the laws are with him,
And I'm in the shade,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
As human gods aim for their mark,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
As his youth now unfolds,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
To be without a home,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Can't find what I need,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
That four ears cannot hear him,
I'm going back to Colorado,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Senor, Senor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
That fired the gun,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
They say every man need protection,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
A man with a badge skips by,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Oh, Angelina,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Just then the order came to charge,
Get dressed, get blessed,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
But you're doing it again,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Six months on the chain gang,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Resent him to the bone,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Father of day, father of night,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Made before the foundation of the world,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Broken lines, broken strings,
You had enough of hatred,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
You gave me babies, one, two, three - what is more? you saved my life,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
I see-I see lovers in the meadow,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Badge out, laid off,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
It always has hit me from below,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
God knows that, when you see it,
I landed up on the downtown side,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb - well,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Well, come all without, come all within,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
In his anger and his shame,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Went back home to the yard,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
I once held her in my arms,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
That can do what's never been done,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Trust yourself,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
You're beautiful beyond words,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Too noble to neglect,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Tell me that you love me only,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
I got a wife and five little children,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Want you so bad,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
And I'm so glad,
A question in your nerves is lit,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
I've been in and out of happiness,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
God knows it's a crime,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
My love, she speaks like silence,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
You can stick your head in the sand,
If you'd see me this way,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble - trouble always comes to pass,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
In another I witnessed a crime,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
May you stay forever young,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
May be an actor in a plot,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Laying low,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
You know--so nasty and you're so bad,
Like a dog on a chain,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
You married young just like your ma,
Every nerve is analyzed,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Not the end, not the end,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Going,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
There was a wicked messenger - from Eli he did come,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
More people kept a-piling on,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Where life and death are memorized,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
On the stone that remains,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," - uh-huh,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
They say every man needs protection,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
And on the highway of regret,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I've been all around the world, boys,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Where the neon madmen climb,
I've been around this whole country,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
She leave by the other and roam,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
To have--be on your own,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
With no direction home,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
It was a girl I learned it from,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
A gentle breeze was blowing - you could feel it from inside,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Ye shall be changed,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
You got to serve somebody,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
And you - and you wish your situation be more drastic,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
I had no one for to go my bail,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused - I remember well,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
God don't call it treason,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
You got something better,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
He's young and on fire,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Judge and jury took their stand,
The human mind can only stand so much,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
You need something to open your eyes,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
But the bottles are done,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
I got a bird that whistles,
Without your sweet love,
For all intended purposes,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
You can raise up your right hand,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
For something that he never done,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
It all seemed so well-timed,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
They must bust in early May,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
She'll surely turn to white,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
My woman needs it every day,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
To find out if she's talked,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Who could they get to carry you,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth--teeth,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Father of night, father of day,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Looking for a new fool,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Senor, Senor, let's overturn these tables,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Far away in the stormy night,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
But I know that he don't talk,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
I just don't see why I should even care,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Nothing was delivered,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
She never does me wrong,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
I want you so bad,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
There's a slow - there's a slow, slow train coming,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Pressing on,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
I have no one to meet,
It still ain't me, babe,
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
I'm leaving today,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
The angels play on their horns all day,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Get back, write Braille,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
A hand set the spark,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
With what your fate is going to be,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Go melt back in the night,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
The night blows cold and rainy,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Pardon me--pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Something about you that I can't shake,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
The day would surely have to break,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Lone Wolf went out drinking - that was over pretty fast,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Just to know that you are near,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Poor boy dressed in black,
She's opened up a happy home,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
But now morning is clear,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
And comes to a permanent stop,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Well, I may just swear,
It's rising up above my head,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
I bless the day I found you,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
When the night comes falling,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Or have done something wrong,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
Yes, and I'll go last,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Like as not, it's better so,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Father of time and father of dreams,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Too serious to fool,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
It could even be like a myth,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
But there's nothing-really nothing to turn off,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Every brain is civilized,
To know how much I really care,
I don't sense affection - no, no gratitude or love,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
You angel, you, you're as f--got me under your wing,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Like you never did before,
Day you quit me, baby,
Want you,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
This place ain't doing me any good,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Revolution [incoherent] no solution for trouble,
Searching everywhere I know,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Over the hills and far away,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Don't follow leaders,
I can change, I swear,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
The sky too is folding over you,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
In the darkness of my night,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Just don't know what to do,
I can't understand,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
They tell me every man must fall,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Need a woman all the time,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
The day you quit me, baby,
Oxford Town around the bend,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Well, there's too much of nothing--can cause a man to weep,
And she'll be coming forth,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Thieving in the alley,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
And point away from the past,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
You want watered-down love,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
The beat is pumping,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
And, though the line is cut,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
And keep your eyes wide - the chance won't come again,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
It always means so much,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
They--they show me to the door,
The country music station plays soft,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Like a rolling stone,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Spend the night with some sweet senorita,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
You follow, find yourself at war,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
You wanna drown love,
And I'm just like that bird,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
People talk of situations,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
You need something to open up a new door,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
As I travel down life's pathway,
And to come each time you call,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Come all without, come all within,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light - ahh, you're right,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
I'm going down the river,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
You'll be doing society a favor,
This world is ruled by violence,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Circled by the circus sands,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
But, if you want me to,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
I got two white horses following me,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
There's always someone who understands,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
But I'm pressing on,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Warning signs are eve-flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
But something has changed,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Try to be a success,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Go away from my window,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
I went back home, put on my tie,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Father of cold and father of heat,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Tears on the letter that I write,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Couldn't even see the floor,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
They keep it all hid,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Cafe,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Said I'm pressing on,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
We live and we die, we know not why,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
I swung on to my old guitar,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
I been good while I been waiting,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
But I will be back, I will survive,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
And the table's full and overflowed,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
I think we better talk this over,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
We take great delight in our own company,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
If you throw it all away,
I got those worried blues,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
So I got those worries blues,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
So, never leave me lonely,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
Hmm, I can make it through,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
Into my own parade,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
When I was in Missouri,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
God knows how to make it flow,
I got my mind made up,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Heading out for the old East Coast - Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
Poor boy never say die,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Hang around the ink-well,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
And I got those worried blues,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Speaking to some French girl,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Now you don't talk so loud,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Father who build the mountain so high,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Read books, repeat quotations,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Senor, Senor, I can see that painted wagon,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
All the silver, all the gold,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
He is centuries old,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
But evidently she don't,
It hurts me, too,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
It's like I ain't here,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mache,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
God knows it's a struggle,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Of this I can't say very much,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
Under the microscope,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
To be alone with you,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
And the point is slick,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Forever young, forever young,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
I just don't know what to do,
Try hard, get barred,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
You have explained every mystery,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
In the hills of mystery,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
I've been saved - well, alright,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Don't try No Doz,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Using every angle under the sun,
Equality, liberty,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
To be on your own,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
But the time ain't tall,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Got my mind made up,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
That long, black train is pulling down,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
All the tired horses in the sun,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched--discover that there was no one true,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
The only son of God Almighty,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Maybe when we both get sober,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
So unknown,
They run a brick and tile company,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
For the politician's gain,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
I don't care if you analyze me,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
We'll go someplace unknown,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Hmm, see what you can do,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
God knows everything,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Someone to open each and every door,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Light yourself a candle,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day--until the day I die,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Front door shut, back door too,
People are crazy, times are strange,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
I rambled out of New York town,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Who will promise never to part,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Come on, come on, stick together,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
People talk over situations,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Keep a clean nose,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Staying far behind without you,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
There she come, now, down my way,
Strangers all give me the news,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
In the ruins of your balcony,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
If I--I didn't have to guess,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
It was you who came right through,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
How did I meet you?--I don't know,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
And she aches just like a woman,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Had no one to go my bail,
You can run down to the desert,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
He won't do nothing to you,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Build you a fire with hickory - hickory, ash, and oak,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
The sky too is folding under you,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
When you're gone--when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
To keep up his hate,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
Ooh, watered-down love,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Now everything's a little upside down - as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
And I'm so glad - I'm glad,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
I don't want to meet your kin,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
You're beautiful to me,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
I'll be on my way,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
My dear, sweet friend,
Well, I'm so glad,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
How does it feel,
By rivers of blindness,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
You have given all there is to give,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
I once loved a woman - a child, I'm told,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Advertising signs, they con,
You've got to serve somebody,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
You were snow, you were rain,
And I got the worried blues,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
I know I've seen that face somewhere, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
One by one they follow the sun,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
She would have married me,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
God knows there's a purpose,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
I like the cool way you look at me,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
To be one your own,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
With the juice running down my leg,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
As the present now will later be past,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Automobile coming into style,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
And it's like I ain't here,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
And furnish me with tape,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
So glad,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Well, I asked for something to eat - I'm hungry as a hog,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
I said, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
But you try with your whole soul,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
You're gonna need - you're gonna need my help someday,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Tell her not to worry,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
And, though it's only my opinion - I may be right or wrong,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
The air is getting hotter,
Someone to close his heart,
Out to the windy beach,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
She got great big hind legs,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
My hands didn't touch him none,
And gathering storms may arise,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
The joint is jumping,
By users, cheaters,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Don't let me drift too far,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
In the instant that I preach,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Tell me,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
When I seen him lose control,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Bring the wife and family,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
If she ain't feeling well,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
My senses have been stripped,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
That five walls cannot hide him,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
Seem like I been down this way before,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Going, going, gone,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Trouble,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
Father of air and father of trees,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
And the whole world is on your case,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Up and down the block,
Take the motherless children off the street,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Better jump down a manhole,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Four by four, no illusion for,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Well, don't know which one is worse - doing your own thing or just being cool,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
On this new morning, new morning,
They say every man must need protection,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Watch the river flow,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
And the sooner you come up with them,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
While riding on a train going west,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
But, to remain as friends,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Yesterday is just a memory,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
And your streets are getting empty,
No, nothing was delivered,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
First degree and second degree,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
And, when it finally--the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Don't ever try to change me,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
And may you stay forever young,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Better jump down the manhole,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
For her to arrive,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Heart of mine, go back home,
All them prophets good and gone,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Joey, Joey,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
I could say that I'd be faithful - I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Grandpa died last week,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Searching high, searching low,
All you can do is do what you must,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
To be out on your own,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
One by one they followed the sun,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I did it for - because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Don't wear sandals,
Saved,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
People going down to the ground,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
God knows there's a river,
Friends with you,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Already the fiesta has begun,
One summer's day he came passing by,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
First to come in was the flying moth,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
A handle hid out in the dark,
You find God in the church of your choice,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Madams light the candles,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Thank You, Lord,
By losers, cheaters,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Looking 'bout the government,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
I never can go because, you know,
You stole her love from me one day,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
They lowered him down as a king,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I'd only have to stay,
And not going through any great extreme,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
It's people's games you got to dodge,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
I had so much left to do,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly - to hurt one, they would weep,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
And played the fife lowly,
Aim well, my little one,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
My limbs are shaking,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
That one doctor cannot save him,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
That you'd have liked me to,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
I don't care if you feel like me,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Yes, I want you so bad,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Father of minutes, father of days,
And I don't want to drag you down,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
But I'm saved,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Just like I did before,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
The Second World War came to an end,
Of ancient history,
Give you my money, honey,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Cares not to come up any higher,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I been good,
Stand up straight and tall,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
He hands--out in your face for kicks,
Ain't no going back,
In the end,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
And you take just like a woman,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
A million faces at my feet,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
If anything is gonna sell,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Don't tie no bows,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
But, if I can save you any time,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
He got that soft, silky skin,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
New morning,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Thinking about the government,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
That two healers cannot heal him,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
My existence led by confusion boats,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Like some mystery,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
"Come along and take a trip,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Love that's pure no accident,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Don't use no green or rotten wood - they'll get you by the smoke,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Heading out for the East Coast - Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
It's a price I have to pay,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
God don't call it wrong,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Without a dream in my heart,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
No llores, mi querida, Dios nos vigila,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
We've killed each one,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
In the little church a-this side of town,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
That foreign sound in your ear,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I--I can recite them all,
There's a place--they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
You better chew gum,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I'll go see them come down my way,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
I ain't looking to compete with you,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
You can hear them tires squeal,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
There was a movie I seen one time - I think I sat through it twice,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Far past the frozen leaves,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
By the night and been to some place new,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I threw it all away,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I went down where the vultures feed,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Adios, mi corazon,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
His eyes were two slits - make any snake proud,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Waiting for the trains,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Winter would have no spring,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
I won't have my nature way,
Baby, please stop crying,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
I could have left this town by noon,
Don't know what to do without it,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
At the close of the day,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Just like a rolling stone,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Dream about you, baby,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Heart of mine,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Every head is so dignified,
Everybody's doing something - I've heard it in a dream,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Stay away from the train line,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
The man in the trench-coat,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
And they--they look at me and frown,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
You and me, we had completeness,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
How he died nobody can say,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
And, although that we're single and free,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
To shine in through,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
It's too bad he had to go,
The best is always yet to come - that's what they explain to me,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Yesterday's just a memory,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
My arms and legs were broken,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans - I was down and out,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
The light I never knowed,
And, if I see the day,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Going home,
Give what I got until I got no more,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
--Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
High water rising, rising night and day,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Don't let me change my heart,
Where mercy walks the plank,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Fare thee well but for a while,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
When she lays upon the grass,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
You even make love just like a woman,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
I want my arms around you,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
We'll fly the night away,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Don't steal, don't lift,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I can finish this alone, honey,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
You always responded when I needed your help,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest - they'd kill me if I lie,
Far away from it all,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Precious angel under the sun,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I can make it through,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Well, the job that you used to have,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Had a dream about you, baby,
God knows it's fragile,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I would not feel so all alone,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Never weak, but always strong,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
The midnight rain follows the train,
I try my best to be like I am,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Seven days,
I went into the city, into the town,
Don't let yourself fall,
In the image of someone you used to know,
To gather flowers constantly,
I see-I see silhouettes in the window,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
Look out, kid,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Need something special-need something special, alright,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
I just keep pressing on,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Eyed through the I Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Stone you and say good luck,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
You don't want a love that's pure,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
If not for you,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Beating for the dead that rise,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Heart of mine, be still,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
She once was a true love of mine,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
Corrina, Corrina,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
If you must cling to someone,
You could look at it and weep,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
To a solid rock,
To be so useless and all,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
And Big Jim was standing there - you couldn't say - surprised,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Private reasons, great or small,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Eh, see what you can do,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
In love and with kindness,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
The kingdoms of experience,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
To your tambourine in time,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Keep me where you are,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Don't know which is worse - doing your own thing or being cool,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
The carpet too is moving under you,
In the turning of twilight,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Giving back all of what you owe,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Each time we meet, love,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Playing around with some sweet senorita,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Well, you're on your own - you always were - in a land of wolves and thieves,
Most of the time it's well understood,
It's not aimed at anyone,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
I went into the city, went into the town,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
God knows it's true,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
That fellow who never blushes,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
The night passed away so quickly,
A complete unknown,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
True love of mine,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Oh, singing just for you,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Wise men say only fools rush in,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
And there's two white horses following me,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Get born, keep warm,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
To stay closer--closer than any friend,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Well, the--Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
That her father was going to hang,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
She'll be coming forth,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
They say every man must fall,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
But, deep inside my heart,
Face full of black soot,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
Made of silver or of golden,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Nothing too very scientific,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
And I'm back in the rain,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
You have given everything to me,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Precious father, loving mother,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
I went down to scrub and rub,
Papa writes to Johnny - johnny can't come home,
Well, I can't understand,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
And forget my pride,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand -
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden -
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole -
I'm sure it was not three -
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write--
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em -
I know everything about this place - or so it seems -
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years -
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion -
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun -
To know where you are -
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home -
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear -
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you -
Something about that movie, though - but I just can't get it outta my head -
For seven long years I courted Sally -
And many a road taken by many a first friend -
But I'm walking and wandering - my poor feet don't ever stop! -
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep -
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow--
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets -
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face -
I long to hold you in the night -
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota -
It nearly swept me off of my feet -
Oh, my-
Whispering your secret emotion -
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve -
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting -
Private reasons - great or small -
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Sometimes it gets so hard to care -
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose -
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal -
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold -
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees -
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship -
Hava-na-
Someone who will die for you and maybe more -
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself -
Yes, and only if she was lying by me -
All that foreign oil - American soil -
The race of the engine that overrules your heart -
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend -
Thank--
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies -
That can win what's a-never been won -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love -
Hang out the whole next day -
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7th avenue -
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast -
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal -
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me -
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door -
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect -
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast -
What happened to him could happen to anyone -
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here -
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break -
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake -
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells -
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear -
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest -
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"--
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years -
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed -
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad -
Ha-va-
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time -
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end -
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" -
With the mystery tramp, but now--but--his eye--
Now, I hope you won't object to giving--
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you -
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan -
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 -
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust -
That's a-hanging in the Louvre -
The judge had the papers in his right hand -
Oh, God, 'cause when - Amsterdam and Paris -
They crammed me back into the county jail -
If I knew for sure that it was yours - but it was, oh, so hard to tell! -
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam -
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes -
Remember me to one who lives there -
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you -
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time -
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none -
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write -
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" -
Now your mouth cries wolf while your--
Into the vacuum of his eyes--
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused - I remember well -
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died -
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me -
The room was funny and I stood up so slow -
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you -
From now on you'd best get on someone else -
I played my guitar through the night to the day -
How badly they were shocked -
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask -
You will not hear a laugh -
From darkness dreams are deserted --
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one -
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand -
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you -
Conversing with my Flora there - it seemed so strange to me -
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love -
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road -
See for me if her hair is hanging long -
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red -
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes -
Haven't seen her since that night -
Let me know, babe - I'm nearly drowning -
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it -
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon -
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted -
It nearly knocked me off of my feet -
Turn, turn, turn again -
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you -
I lived by the window as he talked to himself -
Havana-gee-
About having to be scrounging for your next meal -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear -
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do -
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet -
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun -
Indians camp along her border -
It don't matter who loves who - either you'll love me or I'll love you -
Well, they were sailing about two weeks -
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 -
But I don't think it's liable to happen -
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break -
Disconnect these cables--
I think to myself I might not take it anymore -
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep -
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve -
Without a reply I left by the moon -
And there's really nothing anyone can say -
He looks so truthful - is this how he feels? -
All that foreign oil controlling American soil -
Ten thousand miles or more -
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 -
That's where you belong --
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against -
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark -
He's singing his song for me at his own expense -
Well, I'll sing you a song - it ain't very long -
We just wanted to see some sweat -
But it sure - my loved ones turning into puppets -
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months -
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe -
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 -
She was born in spring, but I was born too late -
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream -
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine -
First degree and second degree -
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed -
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right--
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet -
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal -
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart -
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve -
I return to the Chinese flute - touching me, it wasn't cute -
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes -
Jesus gonna make up-Jesus gonna make up-
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" -
As suicide remarks are torn -
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night -
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone -
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night -
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding -
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" -
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live -
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good -
Can't stand the suspense anymore--
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave -
It won't matter who loves who - you'll love me or I'll love you -
But they got a lot of forks and knives -
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter -
Eclipses both the sun and moon -
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam -
It was for her I'd cross the water -
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean -
I ask you how things could get much worse -
I'll be in Santa Fe about one -
You say my kisses aren't like his -
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king -
I got knocked down and my head was swimming -
He was raving about how he loved my sound -
I a-hope you can hear--
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so -
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land--
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed -
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field -
Though its glow is waxed in black -
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite -
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection -
I hope that you can hear--
And a thousand telephones that don't ring -
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] -
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris -
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile -
But he was just a Pima Indian - no money, no crops, no chance -
With notions his canoe was laden -
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley -
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose -
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch -
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? -
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you -
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright -
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze -
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth -
I didn't know that you'd be leaving -
Staring out the window to the stars high above -
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane -
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days -
[incomprehensible] in the grave - in American future -
I was in your presence for an hour or so -
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day -
With no other choice except but for to go -
I got no idea what I want -
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun -
One of these days - and it won't be long -
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape--well, I won't, but then maybe again I might--
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you -
I didn't commit no ugly sin -
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used -
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get -
Oh, mama, can this really be the end -
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece -
Seven more years I longed to have her -
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved -
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 -
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze -
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat -
If only could hang on and just be her friend -
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend -
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe -
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river -
Havanagee-luh-
I love to see you dress before the mirror -
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived--
You do what you must do and you do it well -
Democracy don't rule the world --
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 -
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" -
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" -
You'd come back and you'd stay -
It can't be this way everywhere -
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Somebody could freeze right to the bone -
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel -
Well, I've sung you my song - it ain't very long -
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me -
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror -
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den -
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose -
Leave all the children home -
Hope he falls upon himself - oh, won't that be sweet? -
Judge had the papers in his hand -
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe -
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed -
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk -
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else -
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed -
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth -
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Like you never done before.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
Leading me, going home.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
I know something is changed.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Put me outta doors.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Must be and that is all.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Mama, you are on my mind.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Fixing everybody's troubles - everybody's 'cept mine.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Is when I'm alone with you.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Alright, that's straight from Chicago.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
You only got ten.
Othello told Desdemona, "I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Everybody got to move somewhere.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
I've seen trouble all my days.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Six by six...
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
It ain't quite the end.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
To hold me in your arms.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
I got nothing left to burn.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
On the way out of Egypt through Ethiopia to the judgment-hall of the Christ.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Oh, Angelina.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
I'll hold it down for you.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
I been worrying about you, baby.
On the caboose of the train.
But I was raised on the other.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl - and me - oh, God! - I'm a one.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
"Don't point your finger at me.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
But all I see are dark eyes.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Oh, her darling love she found.
You have no idea what you do to me.
Feel further away than ever before.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
And the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
But you're back where you belong.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Everyone is either making love or else expecting rain.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Well, the-the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Nothing you can sell me, I'll see you around.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
I just ain't - can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
I need a shot of love.
For the times, they are a-changing.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
He ain't-a got no name.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Come on, baby...
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Watch the parking meters.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
And there's a slow--there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
A-lord, protect my child.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Where teardrops fall.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Last night I knew you, tonight I don't.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Hope I don't blow it.
You can say I didn't give to you.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
Oh, convey herself away.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much.
They let me go right away - they were very paranoid.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
And I've never been too impressed.
From my toes up to my ears.
I can't hear you anymore.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
You are on the bottom.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
That don't apply no more - all from parts of Paris.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
You're my baby.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
I said, "Where we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
My face you'll never see no more.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Hoping you'll come through too.
The sooner you can go.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
He said his name was Columbus. I just said "Good luck".
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
That Johanna's not here.
You'll do as much for me.
A true love of mine.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
It's almost like-almost like I don't exist.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
Just what he was talking about.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
That's really and truly an American.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
That can win what's never been won.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
I'm calling you to-I'm calling you to please come home.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Mine alone.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Someone's watching over you.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
You're the only love I've ever known.
When out comes a farmer - he musta thought that I was nuts.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
Is just equality in school.

Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Madams light the candles.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
Gonna serve somebody.

Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
I want you.
About an old man that never done wrong.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
I'm ready when you are, Senor.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
It always does when you're with me.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
Unless they're from another world.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
And tapestry of rhyme.
I see better days and I do better things.
But that's what I am paid to do.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
I just can't do what I done before.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
What you'll say when you get home.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
'Cause I don't think about it.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
My mind is breaking.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Got my mind made up.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
And relive my dreams.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
You don't have to worry any more.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
Look a-the other way.
For an instant hand touched hand.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Will no--not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling - yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Can't see over to the other side.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Precious memories flood my soul.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Sign on a porch says that "Three's a Crowd".
I just don't think that I could handle it.
But you're never sure why you're here.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum - call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
Dollar a day's worth.
The light I never knowed.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.

Nobility, humility.
And light on your right knee.
Believe in His power - that's about all you got to do.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
I got no reason to be there, but I imagine it would be some kinda change.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Even before you came in the door.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
Well, the world is set against but will never destroy.
Lord, protect my child.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
Until I threw it all away.
And gives it to me for a song.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
I'd like to know.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
In the pale moonlight.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
I did not do it knowingly.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.

God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Heart of mine.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
She might think that I've forgotten her - don't tell her, it isn't so.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.

But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
You better talk to her about it, you're her lover now.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
Trouble...
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Till your error you clearly learn.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
There was nobody around.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the--lonely still.

That set everybody free.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.

He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.

I needed somebody to talk to.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
Alright, thank you very much.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
That brave and devoted band.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
So long, honey babe.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
With your golden loom.
Alright, thank you.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
My love winks, she does not bother.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
What he gets he must pay for - he don't get it out of love.

I'd a-done anything for that woman if she'd only made me feel obligated.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
Knock--knock--knocking on heaven's door.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.

Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Without a love of my own.
Now you stand with your thief - you're on his parole.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Hmm, tell me.
Hmm.
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
But I can't get close to her at all.
It don't matter anyhow.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.

It's done with a flick of the wrist.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.

I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin.
You're drifting too far from shore.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
But there's a slow - yeah, there's a slow - there's a slow train coming.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Come on, honey.
Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Know not what the years may hold.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
And she had left him to die in there.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Headed out for the western skies.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
You-when you knew I had some other place to be.
Honey, come and see about me.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
Thank you.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
The next day could be your last.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
The man, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Neighborhood bully.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I once loved a woman - a child, I am told.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
That I left in the French Quarter.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Take it on down to give me grow.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
When he played and we didn't dance.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
Come on, darling.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
What's real and what is not.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
Ever since I seen her smile.
Using ideas as my maps.
Got ice water in my veins.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Fighting every inch of the way.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
I don't know any more than this.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
If it just don't make me hurts.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
He was [incomprehensible], there was nothing I could do to stop it.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Now they say it's the land of money.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.

I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
It's that million dollar bash.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
For there's a slow--said there's a slow, slow train coming.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
Good car to drive, after a war.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that--if it's them or him that's really insane.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you.
I'm not the one you need.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're-what you are but what you're not.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
And cleaned out the bank safe - it's said they got off with quite a haul.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Yes, you do, you know you do...
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Get ready 'cause today I'll be staying here with you.
Epitome, rigidity.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
Just like so many times before.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
And one day he came passing by.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
His voice was low with pain.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
God knows...
But, mama, you been on my mind.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
Mortality, reality.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
They all fall there so perfectly - it all seems so well-timed.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
Everybody must get stoned.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
And the morning will be breaking.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Under the hedges.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Than people who are most content.
Don't have to look no further - you're the soul of many things.
And come away with me.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
She pretends like we never have met.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Honey, baby.
But you break just like a little girl.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
Some place so high above this wall.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
In the border-towns of despair.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
Then that's how--as long as you'll remain.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
His mama sure was proud of him.
At the end of the trail.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
I left my dreams on the riverbed.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
When I run outta things to investigate.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
And keep away from pranks.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
And you only got ten.
It was a normal day.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
In fond memory appear.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
But the mountains of the past.

Walking around with no one else.

Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
This is from the Mojave Desert.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Food was flying everywhere - I left without my hat.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
Somebody better investigate soon.
Up and down the lonesome town.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
And I'll rock you too.
Down along my restless palms.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
And then go on home and have my fun.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
And I'll go last.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.
My mother was a tailor - she sewed these new blue jeans.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
The hour when the ship comes in.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
People sleeping in broken beds.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Got to have done some evil deed.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
See him at play makes me smile.
And it is time for me to slide.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.

By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
The way you walk and the way you talk - I feel I could almost sing.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
The National Guard stands around his door.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
You're on the bottom.
What looks like the easy way out.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
And now you're better--you're gonna have to get used to it.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
Is what this thing here is for.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
That last night I was with.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
He left her penniless in a state of regret - it was time to bust outta the cage.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
So quickly into autumn.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Down to New Orleans.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.

I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
And she couldn't even recognize his face.
Suffering like a fool.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
I hate bears.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
Figuring a way to get back home.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Sometimes I wonder to just--what it's all coming to.
This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
Trust yourself.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
And like Goliath they'll be conquered.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
Then "lonesome" would mean nothing to you at all.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Oh, got my mind made up.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
Just crying out that he was framed.
That today I'll be staying here with you.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Join the army if you fail.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
Rode slowly back again.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Mary wore three links of chain.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
And your highway's getting filled.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Trying to create a next world war.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
At my window with a broken wing.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
And there's no time to think.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
Nothing done and nothing said.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did - lost a little weight.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
I just can't see through it anymore.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
I finally got a job in New York town.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Wants to get it paid off.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
See like me or be like me.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can.
Baby, baby...
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
The hour that the ship comes in.
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
The National Guard stands around the door.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Yes, he is, now-yes, he is outside my yard.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
But I don't know what "alright" even means.
I got a woman in Jackson - I ain't gonna say her name.
Drifting too far from shore.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
I can't use it anymore.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
68, but says he's 24.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
I've been living the blues every night without you.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
You give something up for everything you gain.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
You'll never see me frown.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Even the softest touch.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Come on, baby.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Just remember that death is not the end.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
He could die happily ever after.
If you won't come out your window.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
When I--he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
And your golden loom.
Hope that it don't sleet.
And wait for succeeding kings.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Said it was a bad dream.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
I got a bird that sings.
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.
I said that.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
And say you'll always let it be me.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Kisses she gave him three.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
And time is beginning to crawl.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.

And someday maybe - who knows, baby? - I'll come and be crying to you.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
But my heart just won't give in.
When my working day's through.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
Everything inside is made of stone.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Step lightly on the ground.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--said like you'd have them do unto you.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song - I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
And he was a friend of mine.
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
And get something quick to eat.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Magic in a magical land.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
Fear to bring children into the world.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
But he sure left here in style.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Lord, I'm walking down the line - my feet'll be a-flying - to tell about my troubled mind.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Humility, simplicity.
68, but says she's 24.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
I got a woman in Jackson - oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
And I-I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
May you stay forever young.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Tell me.
They would not let me be.
Hope you're ready.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Hear me singing through these tears.
They don't make nothing here no more.
As if a wedding vow.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
I can't fight them anymore.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
I want everybody to be free.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
And discovered her invisible self.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Close your eyes, close the door.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Who says she knows me well.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Going back where we come from.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Standing on your window, honey - yes, I've been here before.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
I stood wondering which way to go.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Of every man who put me here.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Most of the time.
I'd be lost if not for you.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
No kindred or relative nigh.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
The whole world is my throne.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
I threw it all away.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Broken voices on broken phones.
I said, "Who's in the fireplace?" And you tell me Santa Claus.
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
A man named Martin Luther King...
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
And I's left alone with three children.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
I can't fire them anymore.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
With the golden loom.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
The words that her lover had said.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
To kill with no pain.
...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
Check to see that no one is escaping to Desolation Row.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
He's only a pawn in their game.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
You're a big girl all the way.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Without this love that we call ours.
Some place so high above the wall.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
And you-you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
In the dark land of the sun.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
When they rode with Villa into Torreon.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
Baby, please come home.
You were always so close and still within reach.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
The country doctor rambles.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
Valentines can't buy her.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
Gone as the season she's taken.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
It's nothing - it's something I learned over in England.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
Please let me ride you home.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
"Get well, get well," said she.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Girls like birds fly away.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
It would go up against every rule.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Living down Sonora way.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
The whole night through.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
Thanks.
I would only let you down.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
Going, going, gone.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
That which is not permanent don't last.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
High society, notoriety.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I took some comfort there.
But there's only one authority - that's the authority on high.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
For the saving grace that's over me.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
And ye shall be changed.
If you don't mind sleeping with your head face-down in a plate.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
It was all over by a quarter past.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them--like you'd have them do unto you.
That's the way I remember her best.
And I need you, yeah.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
And clouds cover up the ground.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
At the sorority sisters' home.
There's no words that need to be said.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
She just acts like we never have met.
But these to tell what's true.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
So, darling, you better come through.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
Remember me to one who lives there.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
An innocent man in a living hell.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
With all these promises you left for me.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
You got it, baby.
He's always on trial for just being born.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Well, the room is so stuffy, I can hardly breathe.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Love and only love - it can't be denied.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
And she'll only know he's dead.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
On this new morning with you.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
Is tearing up your mind.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
I don't even know why we come.
Everybody's having them dreams.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
You may not see me tomorrow.
Until my dying-day.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Wasn't any difference to me.
I froze right to the bone.
'Steada acting like we never met.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
What some people are gonna do for money.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Lay dead beside him there.
I remember her whispering yet.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
And each one I've never seen again.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Where I was born and partly raised.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
In this concrete world full of souls.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
But then again, I said, oh-I said, oh-I said, oh-oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
You won't get it for money.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
The place that I started from.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
But mine was a little different, you see.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Right now I'm having trouble.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
I'll remember you.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
Honey, I want you.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Water pouring into Vicksburg, don't know what I'm gonna do.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it...
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
I only saw what they let me see.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Everything inside here is made of stone.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
To anything I might have tried.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Patriotism, materialism.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
And I need you, ah.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
I got trouble in my mind.

Into the land of the midnight sun.

The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.

And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
And we slept near the Alamo - your skin was so tender and soft.

Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.

Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.

Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
At not getting their money's worth.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Lost time is not found again.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.

"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
You know the song in my heart.
We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
You'd better get that in your head.
But you're not even sure what it is.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row.
To anything I might've tried.

From the little Minnesota town.
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
If you throw it all away.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.

On anyone that lives in a vault.
My sister, she ran off and got married, never was heard of anymore.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Blood on your saddle.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Now and then--now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.

He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Levels my head and eases my mind.

Friends with you.
Memories of what used to be.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Then the mailman comes in - even he's gotta take a side.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.

The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
Under the midnight moon.
All my connections too.
That I really did try to get close to you.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
I know you always say that you agree.
I don't know.
Obscenity - who really cares? - propaganda all is phony.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.

At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.

This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Crumble into one another.

Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Now and then there's a fool--a fool such as I.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.

Everything about you is bringing me misery.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley - that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this-this is a song-this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.

The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
But with the country to where you're going.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.

But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
When you go your way and I go mine.
Just what this song is all about.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
My baby took my heart from me.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.

You to me were the best.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
And I--I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
Only a fool here would think he's got anything to prove.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Mi amor, mi corazon.
It's just the same as talking to you.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
But the fighter still remains.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
I just go pump on it some.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
She's in some foreign land.
I'm just average, common too.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
But you were tangled up in blue.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
If I ride back again.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
The bridge at midnight trembles.
Soft as music, light as spring.
While the law looks the other way.
I think this time we should escape.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
You want a watered-down love.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
Things will be alright by and by.
And watch the parking meters.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Gonna put my good foot forward, stop being influenced by fools.

And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
And I was brought up by my brother.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
I can walk anytime around the block.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
I seen a man.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
I'd do it, but I-I just can't remember how.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
For she once was a true love of mine.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
Throw my ticket in the wind.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
When my memory is not so short.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Our chances really was a million to one.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
He's got his mother's eyes.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Last radio is playing.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
I'm going back to New Orleans - my race is almost run.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he--nobody was glad.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
To see that you're madly in love.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
But I would never do you wrong.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
The same as my father before him.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
That must be what it's all about.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
With the glory that is to be.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Blowing through another no-good town.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
When you made everybody pay.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
She murdered mortal he.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
I stamped out forty compasses, sure don't know what they cost.
Everything is gonna be fine.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
Oh, yes, they did.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
She said she would always stay.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
Yes, tell me.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
I'm younger than that now.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
Leave no stone unturned.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
And it never seemed strange.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Adios, mi corazon.
Bid farewell forever.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
That linger in the fireball heat.
I just can't beg you anymore.
Police at your back.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Yes, and I'll go last.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
That's the day you die.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
Tried to create a next world war.
But then again, I said-again, I said, whoa-whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
In the night the price was paid.
Life don't mean a thing.
Or put up against the wall.
Gal, you're on my mind.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
Sweet lady.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.

My love, she speaks softly.
But it was more than I could do.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
Don't be angry--don't be angry with me should I cry.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
Never will want for money.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
And old Minu--Mister--et paid for his dream.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.
I never saw the man again.
Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
They seem determined to go all the way.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Bring that bottle over here.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
I hope I'm ready.
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Father of love and father of rain.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
And every window made of glass.
Duality, mortality.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
To live it you had to explode.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Find out something only dead men know.
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
I had so little time to fail.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
But I know that I can't move.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
The sooner you can leave.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
By that soft and shining sea.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
I scarcely feel the glow.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You're a big girl now.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
Good as I been to you.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
May you always do for others and let others do for you.
And laid his life on the line.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
That just struck me kinda funny.
I don't believe you.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here-it's, uh-have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd-I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
We all wear the same thorny crown.
Drink up your blood like wine.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Man is opposed to fair play:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
His epitaph plain:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Serve somebody:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
But there's one promise, darling:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Answer me, baby - a casual look will do:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
There's a wall between you--what you want and you got to leap it:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Till I come into New York town:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Yeah, serve somebody:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Crumble into one another;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Make promises by the hour;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
All lies and jest;
Everybody that was hanging out;
So many things that we never will undo;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Some speak of the future;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Nobody can get any sleep - you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
I find complete love;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Outside the crowd was stirring - you could hear it from the door;
Had to be held down by big police;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Are you the same person that was here before?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Before it is washed to the sea?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
And one deserving of affection?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - oh, mama, don't you know?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
"Remember that murder that you--happened in a bar?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Has anybody seen my love?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Didn't I-didn't I try to love you?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
How many more can they afford?
Didn't I-didn't I try to care?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Poor boy, where you been?
Can I come home with you?
What good am I?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Let's take a chance - who really cares?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Baby, can't you tell?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Just like a rolling stone?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
How come you don't send me no regards?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
How could they let you go?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
But who did I see but the one I love?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
What's wrong with you this time?
Before he can see the sky?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Across the swooping plain?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Where did you hide your halo?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
I said I'd send for you and I did - what did you expect?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Must everybody bow?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Have they missed you?
Before he can hear people cry?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
How's everything in heaven?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
What else can a poor boy do?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How much poison did they inhale?
Baby, what more can I tell?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Before they're allowed to be free?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
And the mercy that you showed to me - who ever would have guessed?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go - baby, don't you know?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
How can you say he will haunt you?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
How could they ever mistake you?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
How many more without any reward?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Why and what's the reason for?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Ready, George?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Before they're forever banned?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Is there any truth in that, Senor?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
To love and follow His direction?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime - what do I care?
What would life be?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
How many compared to yesterday?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Across the swamp of time?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Gal, where you been so long?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Too many people have died?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
For all these earthly things?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Who killed Davey Moore?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Don't you know it--don't you know it hurts me, too?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Of everything you see?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Senor, Senor, do you know where she's hiding?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
And how does it feel?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Will there be any comfort there, Senor?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
What can I do for You?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
What?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
How can I live for You?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Are you ready?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Can you get back in?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Oh, what dear daughter would--'neath the sun--would treat her father so?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Where did you lose your wings?
"Oh, how can-how can you ask me again?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
When did you leave heaven?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Why would I want to take your life?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
When he's standing in front of you?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
What can I give to You?
By golly, what more can I say?
Before you call him a man?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
That too many people have died?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
How does it feel?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Am I ready?
What do you think about that, my friend?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Like a rolling stone?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
A lover for your life - a-but what more?
Does anyone even try?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
It was put together down in Argentina
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I will not go down under the ground
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Maybe someday you will understand
He was a clean-cut kid
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
For what you sold that's not been received
And your trouble is you know it too good
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
By no special friend
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Many times I've often prayed
I want you, baby, just to understand
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
Just what you had in mind
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
But she ain't gonna find the road
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
All I remember about it was-is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I thought that it was well-understood
Silvio, silver and gold
The changes I was going through can't even be used
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
She let go of my hand
We live in a political world
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Now you don't act so--so proud
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
"Equality". I spoke the word
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Things would be different the next time we wed
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
But something has changed
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
I still can remember the way that you smiled
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
But all that suffering was not to be compared
So I'll make my stand
Either from the mountains of Madrid
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Now, a very great man once said
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Now, whenever I get up and
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
I had to say something to strike him very weird
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Everything stays down where it's wounded
But now something has changed
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
While some, on principles baptized
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Nothing was delivered
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
And that even the nobles get properly handled
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I run right home and I went to bed
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
I live in another world
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
I'll always thank the Lord
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
It's something you did
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
And then you told me later as I apologized
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
All the sweethearts you can hold
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Its iron claws attached
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
You used--be so proud
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
How many times can a man turn his head
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
And into the path you are hurled
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
To see him obviously framed
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
There ain't nothing in this world
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
You try so hard, but you don't understand
When all - all of the bandits you have commissioned
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now you don't seem so proud
Standing on the water, casting your bread
You used to be so amused
And those whom doom and death had spared
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
As I stand upon the sand
Somebody seen him hanging around
Roving gambler, he was very bored
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
They took a clean-cut kid
And things would be different the next time we wed
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
I've been walking around
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Taking care of somebody nice
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
We see this empty cage now corrode
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
But I feel nothing for their game
I'm sure you're the one to blame
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
Remember me to the one who lives there
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
With all memory and fate
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
But it won't be over till they clear his name
So I remember every face
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
And suddenly there appeared before me
It's all new to me
And I'm just the same as anyone else
I rode with him in a taxi once
So up she picked her babies three
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
When the roses fade
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
I am homeless, come and take me
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
The man the authorities came to blame
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
How was I to know you'd be the one
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
But the dark does die
The crashing waves roll over me
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
That she's the same one
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Just what you will say when you get home
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
On the rising curve
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Up into some paradise
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
And never sat once at the head of the table
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Mona tried to tell me
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
If dogs run free, why not we
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
I can survive and I can endure
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
At dawn my lover comes to me
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Better stay away from those
She plunged him into well water where
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
He'll see by his grave
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
Con you into thinking that you're the one
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
But I can't say I sympathize
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
It's getting dark, too dark to see
How many ears must one man have
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
So I look like a walking mountain range
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Says it's closing time
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
You say you're looking for someone
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
And you see why it's so unique to be
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Well, it's all new to me
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I'm ready for to fade
And that is that one must always flush out his house
When I'm all alone
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
All I feel is heat and flame
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And I ain't complaining none
She been gone
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
Leaving men wholly, totally free
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
You're not free to belong to me
Among the lovely people living free
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
It'll be with me unto the grave
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
What good am I then to others and me
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
To show you something you seen before
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
What's probably got you baffled more
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Little did I realize
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
When Reilly's daughter got a message
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
If dogs run free, then what must be
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
You smiling through the fence at me
And her silver-studded phantom cause
While them that defend what they cannot see
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Should I leave them by your gate
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
Waiting to find out what price
There were times when I was so lonesome
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
I been wondering all about me
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
As he rises to fame
You said you'd never compromise
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
From all the plans they do pursue
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
I do declare
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
To give the special one you seek a chance
What about that millionaire
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
"Oh, father, you will surely die
And plenty time for good romance
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
And the Negro's name
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
Feel to moan, but unlike before
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
The cause was there before we came
You just pick anyone
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
They say don't come back no more
Remember me to one who lives there
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Hunger pays a heavy price
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Limited in sex they dare
But I can get another one
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
So, I called up the operator of time
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
Though its shadow's metal badge
What you're gonna say when you get home
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
You cut to the core
Full of hope and desire
I don't even notice she gone
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And I would send a message
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
She knows there's no success like failure
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
If dogs run free, why not me
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Lies that life is black-and-white
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
When the rain is blowing in your face
From the start by the rule
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
You know, it's not even safe no more
A bed that is never mine
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
"It's only you that he does crave
You into thinking you're the one
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Should I put them by your gate
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Just pick anyone
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Knows there's no success like failure
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Everybody sees hisself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
The order is rapidly fading
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Where the time and the tempo drag
They're drinking up and walking
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
It's not a bad way to make a living
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
If I was with her too long
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Deceived me into thinking
'Cause the battle outside raging
And the cards are no good that you're holding
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
There's nothing in here moving
The order is a-rapidly fading
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
But then a whistle will be blowing
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
For your weary toes to be touching
And you can't-you remember for the best of your thinking
And there's no telling who that it's naming
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Early in the morning, early in the morning
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Beyond here lies nothing
The battle outside raging
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
She rode by night and came by morning
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
You left me standing in the doorway crying
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
And how I know I'll make it through
Look out, the saints are coming through
Then she told us how times were tough
You go north and you go south
I have fallen far beneath
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
But they caught him and they brought him back
And me, I nearly got busted - and wouldn't it be my luck
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
The man in me will do nearly any task
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Shoot in the back
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Her voice once and talk
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
I wish she'd unlock
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
You turn around to take a final peek
Well, there ain't no going back
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
A-how does it feel
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
As the last fire-truck from hell
He's sure got a lot of gall
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Beneath his boundaries - what more if I can tell
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
He's taught in his school
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
All and all can only fall
A girl by the whirlpool
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
How many seas must a white dove sail
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
I chased me a woman up the hill
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
How does it feel
Ring bar, hard to tell
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
But among the dead that were left on the hill
They ask me how I feel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
And if my love is real
How many seas must the white dove sail
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Then why don't she tell
Oh, how does it feel
Soul to soul our shadows roll
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
You better not chew gum
"For you cannot relive them
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
Two eyes took the aim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
But I can hear another drum
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And remain as I am
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
A-she takes just like a woman
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And the smell of their roses does not remain
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
That long, black train is pulling on down
And all their daughters put me down
All their daughters put me down
Have died - have died in battle or in vain
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
And the corner sign
And she aches just like a woman
I wish-I wish-I wish in vain
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
That long, black train is pulling down
From heights that they could not gain
His clothes are dirty, but his--his hands are clean
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
Out of the shower comes a football man
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
As you sit on the box you keep him in
"Not me," said the gambling man
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
But me, I expected it to happen
He got that fortress on the mountain
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Their religion of the little ten women
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
You need something to make it known
Why did you trade heaven
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Somebody new to beat on
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
And there's no exit in any direction
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And you ache a-just like a woman
But all their daughters put me down
Guns and clubs followed him down
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Advertising signs that con
I don't even care if I ever see her again
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Uncle Rat went running downtown
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
To my knowledge there's just one man
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
She said that all the railroad men
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
But I swear I see my reflection
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Well, you fake just like a woman
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
For the loser now might be later to win
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Trying to get a lead on
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Well, I'm hanging on
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
You take just like a woman
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
How can the life of such a man
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
But it's hard to think on
Darkness at the break of noon
Must meet the dawn
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
For the loser now will be later to win
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
My love, she's like some raven
All lay down their bandanas and complain
The next morning she had awoken
Nothing we can call our own
I'll be waiting at the station
Have died in battle or in vain
You don't need a weatherman
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
How many roads must a man walk down
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
The ones that jump on the wagon
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
She got such a sweet disposition
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
But the post office has been stolen
I figure maybe we're even
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
There was little to say, there was no conversation
She takes just like a woman
In the pigpen
To remember the times when I was your only man
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Suicide remarks are torn
The foreign sun, it squints upon
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Yes, and someone must explain
And she wakes just like a woman
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
All I really wanna do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
All I'd like you to do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
There's nothing you can say or do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Well, when all your - all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Silvio, I gotta go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
Tell 'em--everybody down in old Frisco
Every place I wanna go
There is a place you go
Man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What good am I while you softly weep
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
I walked down there and ended up
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
The man in the coon-skin cap
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Aladdin and his lamp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
How many times must a man look up
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
But morning is clear
The wind howls like a hammer
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
So, don't fear if you hear
My ship is in the harbor
When only you are near
I can't stay in here - ain't it clear
I say, "Why you say that for
Never no more do I wonder
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
In one I was running and in another
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
And I don't even think about her
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
When you whispered in my ear
Well, the streets--the face of God will soon appear
Who came here from Cuba's door
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
The face of God will appear
All you boys better run for cover
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
At any moment you could go under
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
I don't have to go far
You heard me saying a prayer for
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
For all eternity I think I will remember
I close my eyes and I wonder
Still I say her love-words over
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
I could feel a whole lot better
Still I've always kind of missed her
Alone you stand with nobody near
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
The lover who has just walked out your door
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
She took him by his long, yellow hair
For I am married to a house carpenter
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
I'm gonna let you pass
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
But, though the masters make the rules
Now, you must provide some answers
And then complains
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
And without further notice asks you how it feels
You been hurt so many times
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I'd gladly confess
Wants eleven dollar bills
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Her window's wide open, African trees
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
The cowboy angel rides
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
And the princess and the prince discuss
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Romantic facts of musketeers
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
With a fantastic collection of stamps
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
You never turned around to see the frowns
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
People on the platforms
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
To the cutting of fences
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Don't wear sandals
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
With a big bouquet of the roses
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
And your father, to your sister he explains
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
And the poor white remains
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Thinking of a series of dreams
And so Patty calls the cops
Mama, you know, awaits the news
At times I think there are no words
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
People carry roses
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
They whisper in the wings
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
True love can make a blade of grass
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Seven days
And inside it with the people made of molasses
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
To memorizing politics
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
As friends and other strangers
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
"Not me," said the man whose fists
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
But still remains
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
You know that he has no intentions
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
In the dimestores and bus-stations
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
And I try to harmonize with songs
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Well, the ragman draws circles
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
Statues made of matchsticks
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
You can fall down on your knees
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And, though the masters make the rules
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Girl by the whirlpool's
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Don't follow leaders
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
To sharpen the senses
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
He's not selling any alibis
You should be made to wear earphones
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
That it's you and no one else that owns
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
We living in times when men commit crimes
Six-time users
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Six-time losers
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And tells me of her dreams
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Good and bad, I define these terms
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
What good am I if I say foolish things
Glide across the lonely years
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
I try to tell it like it is
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
One more night I will wait for the light
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
They tell me revenge is sweet
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Keep it in your mind and not forget
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Our Father would not like the way that you act
How many years can a mountain exist
Yet you know there is no answer fit
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Wait for the morning light
To keep it in your mind and not forget
I'm moving after midnight
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
One more night the moon is shining bright
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Without any doubt
Talking that the heat put
They tell me to be discreet
I got into the driver's seat
You used to laugh about
Everything is always right
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
He really wasn't where it's at
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
You are there in the flickering light
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
With your pockets well protected at last
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
To hold each other tight
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
That might be all that you got
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
The slow one now will later be fast
He built a fire on Main Street
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Plants in the bed, but
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
You're gonna get hit
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
How many years can some people exist
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
In the stillness of the midnight
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Keep me set apart
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
And I, in my armor, turning about
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
So he never thinks straight
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
It don't take too long to find out
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Oh, everybody's got to eat
There's some people that
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Johnny's in the basement
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
You used to laugh-make fun about
Maybe he'll see her once again - how long must he wait
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Maybe she'll pick him out again - how long must he wait
You're hearing my heart beat
You don't forget
Everyone still talks about
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
The slowest now will later be fast
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
I'm on the pavement
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Someday, everything is gonna be different
And the first one now will later be last
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
I soon get some rest
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
In the precious winds they rot
And, since my feet are now fast
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
She seems too far out
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
By the way, that's a cute hat
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
But, if the arrow is straight
Like a corkscrew to my heart
I think that it's best
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
It's just crazy being here with you
I just might have to come see you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
And I tell this truth to you
I can be just like you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
I'll remember you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To protect you and defend you
To be alone with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Yes, I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Well, I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
But sooner or later one of us must know
He been living there three years now
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
It only goes to show
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
I'd sure like to know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
With only you in view
Down every street there's a window
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Sooner or later one of us must know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Don't it always go to show
Don't it always a-go to show
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
The only one I know
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
Spouted out that liberty
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
And I'm leaving every day to run away
How many times must the cannon balls fly
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
She starts to speak, but he walks away
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
She puts it to me plain as day
And the only tune my guitar could play
Is worth more than I could pay
And for His love they took His life away
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
We banged the drum slowly
And the ladies treat me kindly
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
But I wish there was something you would do or say
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
Went to the doctor the very next day
My ears hear a symphony
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
But you can never steal away
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
And it's up to you to say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
And that which you've given me today
To those condemned to act accordingly
Or if you just want some company
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
So I run down most hurriedly
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
She smiles, walks the other way
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
The same thing I would want today
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
I did not do it harmfully
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
I send you all my money
My mind weaves a symphony
She knocked upon it anyway
That I was just a puppet in a play
A cock is crowing far away
Though I'd never say
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
So they took him to the infirmary
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Maggie says that many say
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
From phony jealousy
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Well, I'm walking down the highway
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
That I done it the way
For them that think death--death's honesty
But I can't deny
Don't you tell Henry
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
So, I'm walking down your highway
No, you'll not now or no other day
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
The Spanish-American War had its day
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
If I don't take the chance to try
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
For them that think death's honesty
For them that must obey authority
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
