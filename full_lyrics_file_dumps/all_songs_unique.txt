She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!

That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Get me outta here, my dear man!

"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Dance!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I've got the freight train blues!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
I ain't different than anyone!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
Howdy, East Orange!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
So long, New York!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Yippee!
I got the freight train blues!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Betty Ross!
How they ever flood my soul!
God said, "On Highway 61."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
That you must always first forgive them."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
We want folksingers here."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
You can't blame me at all."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Where you and I will unite."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
So write to her tenderly."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
But we were tangled up in blue."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
Come flowing down so free?"
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
"Have you seen dignity?"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
I'll endow them onto thee."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
And it's all for the love of thee."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
From across that lonesome ocean."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Will mourn for your return."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
He said, "Tell me about it."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
We'll both go home together."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
You can't blame us at all."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
I'll bring back my lady."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
And pretend that you never have met."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
For that reason I will have to stay."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
And have it on Highway 61."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
We'll both go off together."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
You and I'll never know."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Get on your horse and ride away."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
They look as dark as night."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
"That way down Highway 61."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Is it easy to forget?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
But I know what you want."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
They look as white as snow."
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And keep him good company."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
I didn't see you around."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
It's all for the love of thee."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
I can't find my knees."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."

Brighton girls are like the moon."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Tangled up in blue."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
And punched my cigarette."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
And hung on a willow tree."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
To make your time more easy-passing?"
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
You must know about my debutante."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
I love far better than thee."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
Have it on Highway 61."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Country'll grow."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
I would want again tomorrow."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
I'll apply them all to thee."
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
Keep me where you are,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
In the shadows of moonlight,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Take the motherless children off the street,
If your time to you is worth saving,
Tell me that you love me only,
But you were gambling for support,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
But I've been hanging on,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
He's the property of Jesus,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Watered-down love,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
I'm going out of my mind,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Read books and repeat quotations,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Trust yourself,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Of this I can't say very much,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Or select you or dissect you,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
And I'm just like that bird,
I fell down to my bended knees,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I would not feel so all alone,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
In the turning of twilight,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
He's not selling any alibis,
Oh, see what you can do,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
I got those worried blues,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Made of silver or of golden,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
And the whole world is on your case,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
Each one playing a horn,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
The Second World War came to an end,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
The man there said he loved my sound,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Heart of mine, be still,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Day you quit me, baby,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
And give him back the time he's done,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Not the end, not the end,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
People talk of situations,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Just like a rolling stone,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
And it ain't me, babe,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
I won't have my nature way,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Grandpa died last week,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
By losers, cheaters,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Aim well, my little one,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
God knows when,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
And on the highway of regret,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
When the night comes falling,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
They must bust in early May,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
I had no one for to go my bail,
God knows there's a chance,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
The joint is jumping,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
In the lonely night,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
No direction home,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
My love, she speaks softly,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
I just don't know what to do,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
And I don't want to drag you down,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Couldn't even see the floor,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
All I really wanna do,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
And ride a horse along the trail,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
The night would see me wide awake,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
To be so useless and all,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
May be the head of some big TV network,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Is it really any wonder,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
The country doctor rambles,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Go melt back in the night,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
To be one your own,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
For all intended purposes,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
To gather flowers constantly,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
We live in a political world,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
I'd give you the sky high above,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Well, get sick, get well,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I bless the day I found you,
Winter would have no spring,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
When I was in Missouri,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
The wind howls like a hammer,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
That they do not respect in any degree,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
And also by his feet,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Advertising signs, they con,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Just to know that you are near,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
You need something to open your eyes,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
And it's only that I'm asking,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Giving back all of what you owe,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
I got my mind made up,
You stole her love from me one day,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Ye shall be changed,
Just like I did before,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I just can't beg you anymore,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
For her to arrive,
I thank the Lord,
First degree and second degree,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
This situation can only get rougher,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
One by one they follow the sun,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
I try my best to be like I am,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
I couldn't see where we were going,
I want my arms around you,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
Ten thousand men on the move,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Saved,
You made it there somehow,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
But, to remain as friends,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
People going down to the ground,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Hang around the ink-well,
One summer's day he came passing by,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
The haunted, frightened trees,
So, never leave me lonely,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Oxford Town around the bend,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Carved next to his name,
I got a wife and five little children,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Broken hands on broken plows,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
I just keep pressing on,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Broken switches, broken gates,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
The air is getting hotter,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
When I seen him lose control,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Far away in the stormy night,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
Don't wanna be a bum,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
And here I sit so patiently,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Well, I can't understand,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
But it ain't him to blame,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
In the hills of mystery,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Silhouetted by the sea,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
But, it ain't me, babe,
I got a bird that whistles,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Dream about you, baby,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Got my mind made up,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Loneliness, tenderness,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
And I'm back in the rain,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
I went into the city, into the town,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Three angels up above the street,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
I went down to scrub and rub,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
God knows it's true,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
And you know I could never be your own,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Read books, repeat quotations,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
He won't do nothing to you,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Baby, please stop crying,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
God knows you ain't pretty,
But I'm saved,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Who will promise never to part,
Just then the order came to charge,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
But now morning is clear,
Far away and over the wall,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Go away from my window,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
The beat is pumping,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
The kingdoms of experience,
Light yourself a candle,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
God don't call it wrong,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Going, going,
Far away from it all,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Over the hills and far away,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
She would have married me,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Too serious to fool,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
Just don't know what to do,
I shall be released,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Eh, see what you can do,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Oh, watered-down love,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
But ye shall be a-changed,
And rivers that ran through every day,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, the job that you used to have,
I'm going back to Colorado,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
One by one until there were none,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
You to me were true,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
I have no one to meet,
As the present now will later be past,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Got me a secret membership card,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Cares not to come up any higher,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Love that's pure no accident,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I get my sweet reward,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
You have explained every mystery,
Face full of black soot,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Look out, kid,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
All you can do is do what you must,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Dust on my face and my cape,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
You and me, we had completeness,
So glad,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Equality, liberty,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
But he can't be blamed,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
Without a dream in my heart,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
It's really something,
And ye shall be a-changed,
In one the surface was frozen,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
She's crying like an evil stone,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
God knows there's a heaven,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
I threw it all away,
My dear, sweet friend,
Private reasons, great or small,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
While paupers change possessions,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
More people kept a-piling on,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Yes, I want you so bad,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
They say every distance is not near,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
Heart of mine,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
It was from her ship sailing,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
You have given everything to me,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Eh, singing just for you,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Each time we meet, love,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
My senses have been stripped,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
In the darkness of my night,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
But it would not be new,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
With a killer's pride, security,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Searching everywhere I know,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Seven days,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Don't let yourself stumble,
I just say no thanks,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Bringing me all of your charms,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Two by two they step in the dark,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
I'd be sad and blue,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
The sky too is folding over you,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
This world is ruled by violence,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Mercury, gravity,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
And it's like I ain't here,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
I can finish this alone, honey,
A true love of mine,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Trouble,
You want watered-down love,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
I can't understand,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
You even make love just like a woman,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
I wish tonight were here,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
That her father was going to hang,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
The day would surely have to break,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
The country music station plays soft,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
Like a dog on a chain,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Who among them would try to impress you,
My arms and legs were broken,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Try hard, get barred,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Don't let her know,
Try to be a success,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Well, I'm so glad,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
He is centuries old,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
And, if I see the day,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Silvio, I gotta go,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
If you must cling to someone,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
One more night the stars are in sight,
It's too bad he had to go,
You better duck down the alleyway,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Ain't no going back,
Where I will always be renewed,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
You need something to open up a new door,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Carry the New York Times,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
In the great unknown,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Up and down the block,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
That the laws are with him,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Like some mystery,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
You got something I want plenty of,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
But you're doing it again,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
They say that every man must fall,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
By rivers of blindness,
Look who's back in town,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
So many roads, so much at stake,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Every nerve is analyzed,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Father of day, father of night,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
But he's the property of Jesus,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
And, though the line is cut,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
I went into the city, went into the town,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
See you fly or watch you die,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Stand up straight and tall,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Heart of mine, go back home,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
I'll be on my way,
A complete unknown,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
People carry roses,
Don't try No Doz,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
I'm leaving today,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Who could they get to carry you,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
She leave by the other and roam,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
It don't matter what you did,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
I know I can't win,
You married young just like your ma,
Staying far behind without you,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Give you my money, honey,
Circled by the circus sands,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Wintertime in New York town,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I'm never, never far from home,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
With no direction home,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Stripping away at it all,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
We'll fly the night away,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
That fellow who never blushes,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
There she come, now, down my way,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Four by four, no illusion for,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
You were snow, you were rain,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
True love, they've been without it,
Get back, write Braille,
Without ideals or violence,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
We take great delight in our own company,
Don't let her see that you need her,
God knows there's a purpose,
You have given me life to live,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Eh, in somebody's room,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Something about you that I can't shake,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Yesterday's just a memory,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
The sky too is folding under you,
When there is no more,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Badge out, laid off,
Make you spin or do you in,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
You can run down to the desert,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
They lowered him down as a king,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
New morning,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
And she makes love just like a woman,
I been good,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
"Come along and take a trip,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
Don't let her hear,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
You had enough of hatred,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
Get born, keep warm,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Fare thee well but for a while,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
God don't call it treason,
And I––I walk out on my own,
And may you stay forever young,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
Never did feel this way before,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
I can't cross the line, you know,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Laying low,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Precious angel under the sun,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
Broken idols, broken heads,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
On the stone that remains,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Human gods aim for their mark,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
And I'm in the shade,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
The winter would hold no spring,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Tell her not to worry,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Socialism, hypnotism,
To a solid rock,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
I've been around this whole country,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
If you'd see me this a-way,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
In a pine box for all eternity,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
I had so much left to do,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
The night passed away so quickly,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
I'd already gone the distance,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
At the close of the day,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Gonna serve somebody,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
Every head is so dignified,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
I can see the turning of the key,
Tell me,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
There's always someone who understands,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
They––they show me to the door,
Don't tie no bows,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Yesterday is just a memory,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Stone you and say good luck,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Now you don't talk so loud,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
When she lays upon the grass,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
One by one they followed the sun,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
I got two white horses following me,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
At ships with tattooed sails,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
True love of mine,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
She got great big hind legs,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
To be on your own,
Don't mind the driving rain,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
Stone you when you are young and able,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I don't want to meet your kin,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
China doll, alcohol,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I want you so bad,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
The man in the trench-coat,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Thank You, Lord,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Better jump down a manhole,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
I got no place left to turn,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
In love and with kindness,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
God sees it all unfold,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
I once held her in my arms,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
A handle hid out in the dark,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
You could look at it and weep,
You got to serve somebody,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
You're beautiful to me,
God knows how to make it flow,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
I been good while I been waiting,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
I've been saved – well, alright,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
Never weak, but always strong,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
We've killed each one,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
And there's two white horses following me,
They keep it all hid,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
And think they're fooling you,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
You can hear them tires squeal,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Going, going, gone,
And every cause that ever I fought,
That must be what it's all about,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Front door shut, back door too,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
You were striped, you were plain,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
It still ain't me, babe,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
You'll be doing society a favor,
I don't wanna fake you out,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
It's rising up above my head,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
She'll be coming forth,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
She said she would always stay,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
If she ain't feeling well,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Better jump down the manhole,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
If today was not a crooked highway,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
With what your fate is going to be,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
And played the fife lowly,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Well, the way I love that woman,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
The light I never knowed,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Watching the river flow,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Want you so bad,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Drifting too far from shore,
Oh, in somebody's room,
You will be alright, girl,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Father of black, father of white,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
And I got the worried blues,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
They say every man need protection,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Ever since I been a child,
A hand set the spark,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
They say everything can be replaced,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
You have given me eyes to see,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
And come every time you call,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Give what I got until I got no more,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
Don't let her know that you love her,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
I been riding the midnight train,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
You have laid down Your life for me,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Without your sweet love,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
For his age he is wise,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Father of cold and father of heat,
If you throw it all away,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
But I'm pressing on,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Six months on the chain gang,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
They say every man must need protection,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
My limbs are shaking,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Mixing up the medicine,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
Makes no difference where she's been,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
Too noble to neglect,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Broken threads, broken springs,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
You can raise up your right hand,
Madams light the candles,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Stay away from the train line,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
You don't have to feed me,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
I don't care if you feel like me,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
When all will be well,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
A million faces at my feet,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Yet every distance is not near,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
And forget my pride,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Using every angle under the sun,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
How many times have you heard someone say,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
To be alone with you,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
But the time ain't tall,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Joey, Joey,
May be an actor in a plot,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
You follow, find yourself at war,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Don't let her see,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
To know how much I really care,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
If ever I prove false to you,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
God knows it's a crime,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And pretend that we never have touched,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Get dressed, get blessed,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Without a love of my own,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Everything's a-hers or his,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
I went out last night to take a little round,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
May you stay forever young,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Whether you are right or wrong,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
And point away from the past,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Courage is a thing of the past,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
When you think that you've lost everything,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Memory, ecstasy,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
You've got to serve somebody,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
It's like I ain't here,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
May be living in another country under another name,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
"Not me," said his manager,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
I'm so glad,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Searching high, searching low,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I think we better talk this over,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I don't care if you analyze me,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
Speaking to some French girl,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
With the juice running down my leg,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
God knows it's outta sight,
From their fates try to resign,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
She never does me wrong,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
God knows it's terrifying,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
When it costs too much to build it at home,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
It could even be like a myth,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Don't follow leaders,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
For something that he never done,
They don't believe in mercy,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
In the little church a-this side of town,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Strangers all give me the news,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
And not going through any great extreme,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
And to come every time you call,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Don't you tell Henry,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
So unknown,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Had no one to go my bail,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Come on, come on, stick together,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
But I know that he don't talk,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
All them prophets good and gone,
She once was a true love of mine,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Well, I been gambling so long,
I never can go because, you know,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Don't let her see where you're going,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Don't matter what you did,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Is used, it is plain,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
To be out on your own,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
In his anger and his shame,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Don't wear sandals,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
As his youth now unfolds,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Look away, you rolling river,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
But evidently she don't,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And I know what you're thinking of,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
If anything is gonna sell,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
While riding on a train going west,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
To find out if she's talked,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
God knows it's a struggle,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
But, deep inside my heart,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
She's opened up a happy home,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Adiós, mi corazón,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
I long to see you in the morning light,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
They say every man must fall,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Keep a clean nose,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Watch the river flow,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
Friends with you,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Come all without, come all within,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Can't find what I need,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Camping out all night on the veranda,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
And gathering storms may arise,
Don't let yourself fall,
Spent my money on you, honey,
It was a girl I learned it from,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Looking for a new fool,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
To strict party-platform ties,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Automobile coming into style,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Since you've been gone,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
To protect his white skin,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
That five walls cannot hide him,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Why she did go,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
To be without a home,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
The only son of God Almighty,
But I will be back, I will survive,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Over your senses you have no control,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
In the ruins of your balcony,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
If not for you,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Going,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Of ancient history,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
It hurts me, too,
Simplify you, classify you,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Like a complete unknown,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
All the silver, all the gold,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
How he died nobody can say,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
And it still ain't me, babe,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Someone to close his heart,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
That one doctor cannot save him,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Well, I gave you all my money,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
And she'll be coming forth,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
People talk over situations,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Where life and death are memorized,
And your streets are getting empty,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
He been around the world and back again,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
That can do what's never been done,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
In the end,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Went to the station down in the yard,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
That you'd have liked me to,
But you try with your whole soul,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Every brain is civilized,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
But she's drifting like a satellite,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
If I didn't have to guess,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Father who build the mountain so high,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Or have done something wrong,
I need a shot of love,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
How does it feel,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Says he's got a bad bill,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Thinking about the government,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
And I'm so glad,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
It was you who came right through,
They took a clean-cut kid,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
And furnish me with tape,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Loyalty, unity,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
If'n you don't know by now,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Someone to open each and every door,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Like as not, it's better so,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
I'm going down the river,
To hang and to lynch,
Waiting for the trains,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
You got something better,
Don't let me change my heart,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
You wanna drown love,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
To be––direction home,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
And you make love just like a woman,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
To shine in through,
A man with a badge skips by,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
Oh, Angelina,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
By users, cheaters,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Most of the time it's well understood,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Oh, singing just for you,
She said she would never forget,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Holding his club like he was a king,
The day you quit me, baby,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
You better chew gum,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Like you never did before,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
You have given all there is to give,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Nothing too very scientific,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
God knows it's fragile,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
But it ain't me, babe,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Into my own parade,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
I'd only have to stay,
Vanished from my hand,
I just can't do what I've done before,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Roll, Willie, roll,
Don't ever try to change me,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
To have––be on your own,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
For she ain't the same,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
For the politician's gain,
Father of night, father of day,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
But, if you want me to,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
I swung on to my old guitar,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
A foreign sound to your ear,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Somewhere down the road some day,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
God knows that, when you see it,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Looking 'bout the government,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Went back home to the yard,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
You'll change your last name, too,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
I rambled out of New York town,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Maybe when we both get sober,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
If you can't quit your sinning,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
Going home,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
That two healers cannot heal him,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Pressing on,
Hmm, I can make it through,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
You gotta look some other place,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Father of air and father of trees,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Corrina, Corrina,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
As the daylight hours do increase,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
And to come each time you call,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
But something has changed,
I'll go see them come down my way,
For the wise men and the fools,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
With his fist in a clinch,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Relationships of ownership,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
If you'd see me this way,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Forever young, forever young,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Precious father, loving mother,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
But, if I can save you any time,
Ah, get sick, get well,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
God knows you've got to weep,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
My woman needs it every day,
And the point is slick,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Tears on the letter that I write,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
A dream about you, baby,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
No, nothing was delivered,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
Drag you down or drain you down,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Need a woman all the time,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
My hands didn't touch him none,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
A thousand miles from home,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Well, come all without, come all within,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Said I'm pressing on,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
She'll surely turn to white,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Love don't have any place,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
To keep up his hate,
Nothing was delivered,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Well, there ain't no going back,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
It's a price I have to pay,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Well, I may just swear,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
I should have left this town this morning,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Go down to the river, babe,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
Like a rolling stone,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
Don't let me drift too far,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Resent him to the bone,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
Paradise, sacrifice,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
And, if anybody asks me,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
But I would not feel so all alone,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
It always has hit me from below,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
So I got those worries blues,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
"Not I," said the referee,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
It's alright,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
But the bottles are done,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Is looking for a new fool,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
To hide 'neath a hood,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
God knows there's a river,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
And, if I can save you any time,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
Bring the wife and family,
Icicles hanging down,
It's not aimed at anyone,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And the table's full and overflowed,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
They say every man needs protection,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Hmm, see what you can do,
My existence led by confusion boats,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
But, if I will save you the time,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
I can't be good, baby,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And they––they look at me and frown,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Well, I don't mind dying,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Thieving in the alley,
To your tambourine in time,
And I got those worried blues,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
On this new morning, new morning,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,

Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Under the microscope,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I want you,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
That fired the gun,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,

Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Want you,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,

With his candle lit into the sun,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,

I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I got the worried blues,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Serve somebody,
Well, well, well,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
And she aches just like a woman,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,

One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,

How he died nobody could say,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,

They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
And, although that we're single and free,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
In the instant that I preach,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
To stay closer than any friend,

And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,

I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
Rode slowly back again.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
With your golden loom.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
I can't see through it anymore.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Close your eyes, close the door.
My face you'll never see no more.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And ye shall be changed.
I did not do it knowingly.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
The night will soon be gone.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Kisses she gave him three.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Rain would gather too.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
He's got his mother's eyes.
That don't come back with stories untold are hanging on a tree.
Who looked so fine at first, but left looking just like a ghost.
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
And guarded them as they fell.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Everything is criticized when you are in need.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
Leading me, going home.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
His mama sure was proud of him.
The country doctor rambles.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
My baby took my heart from me.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
All my connections too.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
You should never let other people get your kicks for you.
On the caboose of the train.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
With the serpent eyes of obsidian.
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
But that's what I am paid to do.
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
For an instant hand touched hand.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
"Strike three," the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
Down to New Orleans.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
I had so little time to fail.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
With gold and silver in her hand.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
By that soft and shining sea.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
To make me think I'm wrong.
"Get well, get well," said she.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
All because his face was brown.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Good car to drive, after a war.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
And your golden loom.
Tell me that it isn't true.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, I'm still a million miles from you.
Chain you down or be your clown.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
To anything I might have tried.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
But he sure left here in style.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
Someone who will die for you and more.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
Oh, got my mind made up.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
From the little Minnesota town.
Until I threw it all away.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
I froze right to the bone.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
Until my dying-day.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
There was nobody around.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
"And light on my right knee.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
I can walk anytime around the block.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
And no time to think.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Suffering like a fool.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
People bending broken rules.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
You don't have to worry any more.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
And the morning will be breaking.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
What's real and what is not.
To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
But these to tell what's true.
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I will only let you down.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
I'm a poet, I know it.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
Going through all these things twice.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
I just can't do what I done before.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
You had no faith to lose and you know it.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
They say that you're planning to put me down.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
Sweet lady.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
And build you a house made outta stainless steel.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
And then unto eternity.
And crime don't have a face.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
Tell me.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
Tomorrow will be another day.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
But, yeah, I think it can be very easily done.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Mine alone.
Let hot iron blow as you raise the shade.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
'Cause I don't think about it.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Please quit your low-down ways.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Just what he was talking about.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
I just can't beg you anymore.
But your heart is like an ocean, mysterious and dark.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
I'm looking for a woman needs a worried man.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
While evening slips away.
And I's left alone with three children.
The hour when the ship comes in.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
I'll remember you.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Chain you down or bring you down.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
And, foaming at the mouth, he began to make his midnight creep.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
And then she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
Hear me singing through these tears.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
But all I see are dark eyes.
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide.
Carry for you deep down inside.
In the palace of the Pope.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Patriotism, materialism.
Oh, her darling love she found.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Magic in a magical land.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant, he cried.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
Meet me in the middle of the air.
The sooner you can go.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
With an iron chain around his neck.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
But you break just like a little girl.
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit.
And I nearly starved to death, boys, he did mistreat me so.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
I was sitting down thinking of you.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.
May you stay forever young.
Or define you or confine you.
That's the way I remember her best.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
The National Guard stands around his door.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
You're a big girl now.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
What some people are gonna do for money.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.
I can't fire them anymore.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
A true love of mine.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Orders from the D.A.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
And she had left him to die in there.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
And she'll only know he's dead.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
But my heart just won't give in.
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
Come on, baby...
I fought it full without regret or shame.
And I want you to be that woman.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
You'd better get that in your head.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
It would go up against every rule.
I'd like to know.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
They both rode off together.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
Put me outta doors.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Never been so easy or so slow.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
With all these promises you left for me.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
To hold me in your arms.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Drifting too far from shore.
You'll do as much for me.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
Baby, baby...
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
I can't use it anymore.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
The words that her lover had said.
Oh, yes, they did.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
And rivers that ran through every day.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Friends with you.
My mother was a tailor – she sewed these new blue jeans.
On this new morning with you.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Throw my ticket out the window.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
My friends, they couldn't have been kinder.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship than gone to Botany Bay.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
Take it on down to give me grow.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
We all know for sure that it's real.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
Blood on your saddle.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Looking for a new friend.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
Is what this thing here is for.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
But you're back where you belong.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
But jumping Qs and making haste, you know, it ain't my cup of meat.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
So long, honey babe.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
What looks like the easy way out.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
She acts like we never met.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
Got ice water in my veins.
Mama, you been on my mind.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
And relive my dreams.
And discovered her invisible self.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
Girls like birds fly away.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
I got trouble in my mind.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
And get something quick to eat.
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
An innocent man in a living hell.
Rifle on her shoulder, six-shooter in her hand.
I got nothing left to burn.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
'Steada acting like we never met.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
They've been there since Christmas morn.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
In this concrete world full of souls.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
I pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
Mortality, reality.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
And tapestry of rhyme.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
And disregards the rest.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
I'd be lost if not for you.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
They call, that simple twist of fate.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Said it was a bad dream.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
I remember her whispering yet.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
I don't care what in the world you do.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
That big, old boat started to sink.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
In the brightness of my day.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
68, but says she's 24.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
I want everybody to be free.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
Last radio is playing.
She murdered mortal he.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
So you might not know exactly how I feel.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
While I'm in the hall.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
Cost a quarter, half-price.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
That number eleven was closing.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
If I say I'm loving you not for you're–what you are but what you're not.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
My love winks, she does not bother.
You give something up for everything you gain.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
She's a humdinger, folksinger.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
I got nothing, ma, to live up to.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
Some place so high above the wall.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Just you and me.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
It runs both cold and deep.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Like you never done before.
From my toes up to my ears.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Leave no stone unturned.
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.
Dollar a day's worth.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
A man lost all his money, said Willie was to blame.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Know not what the years may hold.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
I just ain't – can't face to tell 'em, honey, you just went away.
To anything I mighta tried.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Feel further away than ever before.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
You can have love, but you might lose it.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
In my Cadillac.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
And clouds cover up the ground.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Come on, darling.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
It can't be this way everywhere.
That just struck me kinda funny.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
68, but says he's 24.
"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
With the golden loom.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
She said she would always stay.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
If you'll only let your hair hang low.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
He's only a pawn in their game.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Take heed of the stormy weather.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
Baby, please come home.
She knows I'm not afraid to look at her.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Keeping one step ahead from the persecutor within.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
Oh, Angelina.
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
I know something is changed.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Where teardrops fall.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
I would only let you down.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Can't see over to the other side.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Or stay all night with thee.
When my memory is not so short.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Living down Sonora way.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
Pick up your money and pack up your tent, you ain't going nowhere.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.
You got a heart of stone.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Even the president of the United States sometimes a-must have to stand naked.
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
And, as she was letting go her grip, up Tom Paine did run.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
And shot it fulla holes.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
I had something to protect.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
They don't make nothing here no more.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
It ain't quite the end.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
But I never yet found Fennario.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Just to take somebody's money away.
And he was a friend of mine.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Neighborhood bully.
Of every man who put me here.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Sara, oh, Sara, loving you is one thing I'll never regret.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
Yes, tell me.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
All because of the color of his skin.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
You're my baby.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Mama, you are on my mind.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
"Pray for peace!" he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
Yes, I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Most of the time.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Nobody stops to ask why.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
Well, I'm just thumping.
Mona tried to tell me to stay away from the train line.
Well, you probably don't know me at all, but I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears.
And the mailbox is locked.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
So quickly into autumn.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Someone's watching over you.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
She tried to dance, but she didn't know how, uh-huh.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
Headed out for the western skies.
To reach of your rattling drums.
If you're a doctor, I need a shot of love.
Give my blankets to my buddies, give the fleas to Diamond Joe.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
The stores one by one, they're folding.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador.
At the end of the trail.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
I got nothing to go back to now.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Going, going, gone.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
High society, notoriety.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Who says she knows me well.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
You were always so close and still within reach.
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
She packed it all up in a suitcase.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Did so many things I never did intend to do.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
Baby, two feet from the well.
He ain't-a got no name.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
You to me were the best.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
But simply because it's true.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
God knows...
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
That's the day you die.
They stopped and stared and they went their way.
With my suitcase in my hand.
But I can't get close to her at all.
I got a bird that sings.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
Down along my restless palms.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
It was you who understood.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Gonna serve somebody.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Who always was too proud to beg.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
I'll be your baby tonight.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
We were the wrong side.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Memories of what used to be.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
In the pale moonlight.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Looking for the places only they would know.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Things will be OK, you wait and see.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him his head began to spin.
I think this time we should escape.
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Soft as music, light as spring.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
You're a big girl all the way.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
And it is time for me to slide.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
You're my honey.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
That's George Lincoln Rockwell.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
Well, I've been up all night leaning on the windowsill.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Drink up your blood like wine.
Epitome, rigidity.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.
Everybody must get stoned.
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.
His enemies say he's on their land.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
Without ideals or violence.
I'm falling in love with you.
You're too hot, darling.
You only got ten.
When I run outta things to investigate.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
And when I was through, I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
But you were tangled up in blue.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
About an old man, he never done wrong.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still can even breathe.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Waiting on my burying ground.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
You can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
I didn't feel so cold then.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
And, now, I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
I long to reach for you in the night.
See him at play makes me smile.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
It's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
You don't want me, give my money back.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
I am only human, but you are so divine.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
And you only got ten.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
My mind is breaking.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
The sooner you can leave.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And the night blows rainy.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
I never saw the man again.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Because everybody must get stoned.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
In an oil refinery.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
If you just let me follow you down.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.
But it was more than I could do.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Funny way to start a picnic.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
It don't matter, anyhow.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Father who turneth the rivers and streams.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
The place that I started from.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
And I need you, ah.
Streets are filled with broken hearts.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Everybody's having them dreams.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
And then go on home and have my fun.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
With his wife and five children and his cabin broken down.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
I been worrying about you, baby.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
The next day could be your last.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
"I never knew it was gonna be this way.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
You're gonna need my help someday.
Is when I'm alone with you.
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
And it never seemed strange.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
It only brings me sorrow.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
What he gets he must pay for – he don't get it out of love.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Is tearing up your mind.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
And all your raging glory.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Somebody's got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
And that failure's no success at all.
When he played and we didn't dance.
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
Foundationed deep somehow.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
She pretends like we never have met.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
There's a guy I gotta see.
Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
My baby stole my heart from me.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
You to give your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Going back where we come from.
The way you walk and the way you talk – I feel I could almost sing.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Unless they're from another world.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Someone I really could care for.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
And I've never been too impressed.
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
And watch the parking meters.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
I hope you're ready.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.
And say you'll always let it be me.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
Where the miners work almost for nothing.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
In fond memory appear.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Or put up against the wall.
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Hmm, tell me.
So don't think twice, it's alright.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
Everything is broken.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
All under strong delusion, all of their beds're unmade.
I don't even know why we come.
They all fall there so perfectly – it all seems so well-timed.
You are on the bottom.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
Adiós, mi corazón.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready for the show.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
You gave me a map and a key to your door.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Every link was Jesus's name.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
For she once was a true love of mine.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
So, darling, you better come through.
And your highway's getting filled.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Wasn't any difference to me.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
And just for that one moment I could be you.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
A .44 smokeless under my head.
A-lord, protect my child.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
Honey, come and see about me.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Oh, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
Crying out that he been framed.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
They found him dead in the street one day.
She did not see her soldier son in sight.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
Never will want for money.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
Nobility, humility.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
It's a hard rain's gonna fall.
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
I need a shot of love.
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
To see that you're madly in love.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
Somebody better investigate soon.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Under the hedges.
And they gotta cut something.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
Hope that it don't sleet.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
But you're not even sure what it is.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, some jealous monk.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
I told 'em I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
Duality, mortality.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
I'm younger than that now.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 'bout dignity.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
But he was never known to hurt an honest man.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Even a pawn must hold a grudge.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Take me as I am or let me go.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
That linger in the fireball heat.
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
My belt buckle's from the Amazon.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
To the sin of love's false security.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
The whole night through.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Try to avoid the scandals.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
Just what this song is all about.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
I've followed the river and I got to the sea.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
I don't have no sports car and I don't even care to have one.
Who don't how to do you wrong.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
Everything is gonna be fine.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
I'm sad and lonely too.
Honey, I want you.
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
You discover that you'd just be one more person crying.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Preaching faith and salvation, waiting on the night to arrive.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
I'd give anything to be with you.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
It was a normal day.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Is just equality in school.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
Yes, and I'll go last.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
So many people I never saw in my life.
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
Just remember that death is not the end.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Mary wore three links of chain.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
Step lightly on the ground.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
Everything looks a little far away to me.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
And make promises by the hours.
Is gonna be against the law.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
It hurts me, too.
I just go pump on it some.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
You want a watered-down love.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Looked in the glove compartment of my car.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Rain would gather, too.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
You know, I just couldn't make it by myself, I'm a little too blind to see.
That must be what it's all about.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
I finally got a job in New York town.
Reality has always had too many heads.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Blues wrapped around my head.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
To be alone with you.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
You got to be made to be wearing a telephone.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
You don't have to be afraid.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
I see better days and I do better things.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
"Don't point your finger at me.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
You sound like a hillbilly.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
Where I was born and partly raised.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
And a fake beard plastered on her brow.
Ever since we've been apart.
She can't find him anywhere.
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Baby, baby.
And keep away from pranks.
"How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
I threw it all away.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
But there's only one authority – that's the authority on high.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
For the times, they are a-changing.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
You've had time to think about it for a while.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
I's looking around just to see myself.
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
And light on your right knee.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Hoping you'll come through too.
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
And they were both out on Highway 61.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
No kindred or relative nigh.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
I want you.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
My baby told me I would have to go.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
That's really and truly an American.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
And all I see are dark eyes.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
And I'll rock you too.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
You know the song in my heart.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
But with the country to where you're going.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
As the present now will later be past.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Just crying out that he was framed.
You can show me a new place to start.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Go find out something only dead men know.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
He gone north for a while.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Saying wants company.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
For the saving grace that's over me.
Now they say it's the land of money.
It's just the same as talking to you.
In fourteen months I've only smiled once and I didn't do it consciously.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
You always got more than enough rope.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Under the midnight moon.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
While the law looks the other way.
Bid farewell forever.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
There were six thousand people there.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
I've seen trouble all my days.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
And the Santa Fe.
Need that woman straight and true.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
If it just don't make me hurts.
If not for you.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.
As they follow each other back up the hill.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
The light I never knowed.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
At the sorority sisters' home.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
Slowly into autumn.
Watch the parking meters.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Just like so many times before.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
You can see that my grave is kept clean.
But I know that I can't move.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Honey, I never would have come.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
Please let me ride you home.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
I took some comfort there.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
Your son is coming back from the war.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Ever since I seen her smile.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
A man named Martin Luther King...
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
That the whole, wide world is watching.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
It always does when you're with me.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
It's that million dollar bash.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
When you made everybody pay.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
Greenwich Village.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn't even have a pair.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
She just acts like we never have met.
At my window with a broken wing.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.
That can win what's never been won.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.
She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
She saw her father's body broken.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
Tangled up in blue.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
To understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Finalize you or advertise you.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, the pigeons gonna run to him.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Buildings going up to the sky.
For me to return to or chase.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Even the softest touch.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suite of clothes.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
To know which way the wind blows.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
But everybody wants you to be just like them.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
That it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to.
Everything is gonna be alright.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
Everything inside is made of stone.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
To see what kinda words he could say.
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
But the fighter still remains.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
To which a scoundrel clings.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around.
To anything I might've tried.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
Thought I was a communist.
I didn't realize how young you were.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Fixing everybody's troubles – everybody's 'cept mine.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Wants to get it paid off.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Even before you came in the door.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
In the border-towns of despair.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
And I need you, yeah.
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
Half asleep 'neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground.
You break your promise all over the place.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
And ye shall be a-changed.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Walking around with no one else.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
When I'm alone with you.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Till I come into New York town:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Serve somebody:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
But there's one promise, darling:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
His epitaph plain:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Man is opposed to fair play:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Everybody that was hanging out;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
I find complete love;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Make promises by the hour;
Some speak of the future;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Crumble into one another;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Had to be held down by big police;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
All lies and jest;
<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?" And, uh, I couldn't do it, I wrote out five pages. And, uh, I have it here–it's, uh–have it here by accident, actually. Ha, but, but, uh, I'd–I'd like to say this out loud, so, uh, if you could sorta roll along with this thing here, this is called "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie".</i>
<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>

<i>Ready, George?</i>
<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
<i>Alright, once again, it's that time of the hour we have to run.</i>
<i>This is called "Talking John Birch Blues" and there ain't nothing wrong with this song!</i>
<i>Here's a story 'bout a ghost come back from out in the sea, come to take his bride away from the house carpenter.</i>
<i>We're gonna start this again, the band was way ahead of me. [incomprehensible] We're gonna tune, we're gonna tune these instruments too.</i>
<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>This is ca––this is called "Yes–" – this is, uh, this is called "Yes, I See You've Got Your Brand-New Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat."</i>
<i>Thank you, you're so very kind, you really are. We will play you this song – I wrote this also about fifteen years ago, it still means a lot to me, I know it means a lot to you, too.</i>
<i>Thank you, that was called "Maggie's Farm".</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>I first heard this from Rick von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Rick's a blues guitar player. I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University.</i>

<i>I don't believe you.</i>
<i>This is a somewhat new song called "Seven Days".</i>
<i>Here's a song about marriage. This is called "Isis". This is for a man if he's still here.</i>
<i>Unlike most of the songs nowadays are being written uptown in Tin Pan Alley – that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this–this is a song–this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States.</i>
<i>This is called "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".</i>
<i>This is called "I Don't Believe You (It Used to Go Like That and Now It Goes Like This)".</i>
<i>Here's a simple love story, happened to me.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you. I'll be here for four more nights, then we'll see you again.</i>
<p>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
<i>Here's a foreign song I learned in Utah.</i>
<i>Alright, that's straight from Chicago.</i>
<i>You're a liar!</i>
<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>This is from the Mojave Desert.</i>
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
What's wrong with you this time?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
How much poison did they inhale?
But who did I see but the one I love?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Can I come home with you?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
How could they let you go?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
How's everything in heaven?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Can you get back in?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Across the swamp of time?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
What can I give to You?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Why would I want to take your life?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
To love and follow His direction?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Just like a rolling stone?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Am I ready?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
When did you leave heaven?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
How does it feel?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Have they missed you?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
But am I still dreaming yet?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Before he can hear people cry?
Gal, where you been so long?
Baby, can't you tell?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
And one deserving of affection?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Must everybody bow?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Why and what's the reason for?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
How many compared to yesterday?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Before you call him a man?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
What else can a poor boy do?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
How can I live for You?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
How could they ever mistake you?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Does he change the course of rivers?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
How many more without any reward?
Across the swooping plain?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What do you think about that, my friend?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Oh, how could you refuse?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Where did you lose your wings?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
Too many people have died?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Who killed Davey Moore?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
And how does it feel?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Before it's washed to the sea?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Does anyone even try?
For all these earthly things?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
When he's standing in front of you?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
How many more can they afford?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Has anybody seen my love?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Are you ready?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
That too many people have died?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
What would life be?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Are you the same person that was here before?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
What good am I?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
So I can know if I'm really real?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Like a rolling stone?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Before they're forever banned?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Before he can see the sky?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Of everything you see?
What can I do for You?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Where did you hide your halo?
By golly, what more can I say?
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
Well, the dog collar's from India
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
You have to pay to get outta
It was put together down in Argentina
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
I will not go down under the ground
Just what you had in mind
How many times can a man turn his head
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Now you don't act so––so proud
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
For what you sold that's not been received
Many times I've often prayed
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
The changes I was going through can't even be used
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Maybe someday you will understand
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
But she ain't gonna find the road
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
It's something you did
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
All the sweethearts you can hold
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
"Equality". I spoke the word
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
They took a clean-cut kid
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Things would be different the next time we wed
While some, on principles baptized
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And your trouble is you know it too good
Standing on the water, casting your bread
You used to be so amused
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Somebody seen him hanging around
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
As I stand upon the sand
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
By no special friend
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Its iron claws attached
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
She let go of my hand
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
I still can remember the way that you smiled
Now you don't seem so proud
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And those whom doom and death had spared
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Nothing was delivered
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Now, whenever I get up and
I've been walking around
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
And then you told me later as I apologized
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
He was a clean-cut kid
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
And into the path you are hurled
But now something has changed
I run right home and I went to bed
I thought that it was well-understood
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
And things would be different the next time we wed
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
You try so hard, but you don't understand
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
We live in a political world
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
I'll always thank the Lord
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
I want you, baby, just to understand
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
But something has changed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
But all that suffering was not to be compared
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
There ain't nothing in this world
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
He wagged his tail and shook his head
So I'll make my stand
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Silvio, silver and gold
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
You used––be so proud
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Now, a very great man once said
To see him obviously framed
I live in another world
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
How was I to know you'd be the one
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
What's probably got you baffled more
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
You said you'd never compromise
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
But I can't say I sympathize
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
And you see why it's so unique to be
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
Everybody's wearing a disguise
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
While them that defend what they cannot see
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Just what you will say when you get home
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And never sat once at the head of the table
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
And plenty time for good romance
On the rising curve
Though its shadow's metal badge
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
The man the authorities came to blame
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
As he rises to fame
From the start by the rule
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Mona tried to tell me
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
So I remember every face
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
She plunged him into well water where
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
Limited in sex they dare
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Up into some paradise
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
She knows there's no success like failure
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
So up she picked her babies three
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
What you're gonna say when you get home
Breaking hearts up and down the line
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
You could almost think that you're seeing double
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
But the dark does die
Hunger pays a heavy price
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Should I leave them by your gate
Looking at hands for the lines that were
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
He'll see by his grave
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Waiting to find out what price
Among the lovely people living free
The cause was there before we came
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
If dogs run free, why not we
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Says it's closing time
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
It's all new to me
From the Golden Gate Bridge
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
A bed that is never mine
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
I do declare
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
There were times when I was so lonesome
Why wait any longer for the one you love
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
I been wondering all about me
It's getting dark, too dark to see
You know, it's not even safe no more
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Just pick anyone
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
You just pick anyone
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
It'll be with me unto the grave
I'm ready for to fade
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
With all memory and fate
That she's the same one
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
To show you something you seen before
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
And I'm just the same as anyone else
What good am I then to others and me
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
And I ain't complaining none
We see this empty cage now corrode
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Maybe someday you will look back and see
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Should I put them by your gate
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
How many ears must one man have
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
I don't even notice she gone
And suddenly there appeared before me
But I can get another one
I am homeless, come and take me
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
But I feel nothing for their game
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
If dogs run free, then what must be
Where I could watch her waltz for free
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
And I would send a message
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So, I called up the operator of time
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Little did I realize
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Taking care of somebody nice
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
You into thinking you're the one
Most of the time I can't even be sure
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
And the Negro's name
They say don't come back no more
The crashing waves roll over me
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
All I feel is heat and flame
You cut to the core
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Remember me to the one who lives there
When the roses fade
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
When I'm all alone
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
I'm sure you're the one to blame
To give the special one you seek a chance
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
You say you're looking for someone
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Full of hope and desire
You're not free to belong to me
But it won't be over till they clear his name
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
She been gone
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
So I look like a walking mountain range
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Lies that life is black-and-white
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
If dogs run free, why not me
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Well, it's all new to me
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
When the rain is blowing in your face
At dawn my lover comes to me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Feel to moan, but unlike before
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
"Oh, father, you will surely die
From all the plans they do pursue
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
See the primitive wallflower freeze
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
A girl who would murder her own, true love
"It's only you that he does crave
When Reilly's daughter got a message
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
I can survive and I can endure
Remember me to one who lives there
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Better stay away from those
What about that millionaire
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Knows there's no success like failure
Well, six white horses that you did promise
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
I rode with him in a taxi once
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
Everybody sees hisself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
Deceived me into thinking
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Early in the morning, early in the morning
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
'Cause the battle outside raging
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The order is rapidly fading
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the cards are no good that you're holding
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
There's nothing in here moving
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
But then a whistle will be blowing
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
If I was with her too long
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
She rode by night and came by morning
They're drinking up and walking
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
For your weary toes to be touching
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
The battle outside raging
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
The order is a-rapidly fading
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
It's not a bad way to make a living
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Where the time and the tempo drag
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Then she told us how times were tough
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Look out, the saints are coming through
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
I have fallen far beneath
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
You go north and you go south
Girls' faces formed the forward path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And how I know I'll make it through
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Well, there ain't no going back
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
The man in me will do nearly any task
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Her voice once and talk
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
But they caught him and they brought him back
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
Shoot in the back
You turn around to take a final peek
I wish she'd unlock
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
He's taught in his school
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
How many seas must a white dove sail
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
I chased me a woman up the hill
Muttering small talk at the wall
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Oh, how does it feel
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
He's sure got a lot of gall
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
How many seas must the white dove sail
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
As the last fire-truck from hell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
How does it feel
A-how does it feel
Ring bar, hard to tell
They ask me how I feel
Ring bell, hard to tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
A girl by the whirlpool
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
And if my love is real
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
But among the dead that were left on the hill
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
All and all can only fall
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
Then why don't she tell
To make all that should be killed to crawl
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
But I can hear another drum
You better not chew gum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
And remain as I am
Two eyes took the aim
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Now, they asked me to read a poem
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
"For you cannot relive them
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
For the loser now might be later to win
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
How can the life of such a man
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
Have died in battle or in vain
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
You need something to make it known
She takes just like a woman
All lay down their bandanas and complain
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
But me, I expected it to happen
Trying to get a lead on
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
That long, black train is pulling on down
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
You take just like a woman
Somebody new to beat on
Uncle Rat went running downtown
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
In the pigpen
He got that fortress on the mountain
And she wakes just like a woman
From heights that they could not gain
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
My love, she's like some raven
A-she takes just like a woman
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Suicide remarks are torn
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
And all their daughters put me down
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
To remember the times when I was your only man
And she aches just like a woman
But the second mother was with the seventh son
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
But it's hard to think on
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
The ones that jump on the wagon
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
She got such a sweet disposition
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Well, you fake just like a woman
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Their religion of the little ten women
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Why did you trade heaven
I figure maybe we're even
The foreign sun, it squints upon
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
And the corner sign
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
"Not me," said the gambling man
But the post office has been stolen
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Out of the shower comes a football man
Darkness at the break of noon
Guns and clubs followed him down
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Yes, and someone must explain
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
But all their daughters put me down
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Must meet the dawn
But I swear I see my reflection
The next morning she had awoken
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
How many roads must a man walk down
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
All their daughters put me down
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
As you sit on the box you keep him in
But the second mom was with the seventh son
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
To my knowledge there's just one man
That long, black train is pulling down
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, I'm hanging on
For the loser now will be later to win
I'll be waiting at the station
And there's no exit in any direction
She said that all the railroad men
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Please don't let on that you knew me when
You don't need a weatherman
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Advertising signs that con
Will not be understood as they're spoken
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
And you ache a-just like a woman
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Every place I wanna go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
There's nothing you can say or do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
All I'd like you to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
Silvio, I gotta go
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
All I really wanna do
There is a place you go
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Aladdin and his lamp
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
I walked down there and ended up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Man in the coon-skin cap
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
The man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
How many times must a man look up
The face of God will appear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
When only you are near
Never no more do I wonder
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
For all eternity I think I will remember
When you whispered in my ear
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
The lover who has just walked out your door
Still I've always kind of missed her
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
I could feel a whole lot better
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
You heard me saying a prayer for
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
The wind howls like a hammer
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
I close my eyes and I wonder
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
And I don't even think about her
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Still I say her love-words over
For I am married to a house carpenter
Alone you stand with nobody near
At any moment you could go under
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
I don't have to go far
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
All you boys better run for cover
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
In one I was running and in another
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
I say, "Why you say that for
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
But morning is clear
Who came here from Cuba's door
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
So, don't fear if you hear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
She took him by his long, yellow hair
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Now, you must provide some answers
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
At times I think there are no words
You never turned around to see the frowns
With a big bouquet of the roses
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
Good and bad, I define these terms
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
People carry roses
And tells me of her dreams
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
With a fantastic collection of stamps
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
I'd gladly confess
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I let it slip gladly to my friends
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
Well, the ragman draws circles
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
How many deaths will it take till he knows
And I try to harmonize with songs
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
You can fall down on your knees
Statues made of matchsticks
Don't follow leaders
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
You should be made to wear earphones
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
To memorizing politics
Don't wear sandals
Girl by the whirlpool's
And so Patty calls the cops
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Wants eleven dollar bills
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
And the poor white remains
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
In the dimestores and bus-stations
But still remains
And, though the masters make the rules
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And the princess and the prince discuss
But, though the masters make the rules
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
And your father, to your sister he explains
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
You know that he has no intentions
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
He's not selling any alibis
I'm gonna let you pass
They whisper in the wings
Thinking of a series of dreams
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
And then complains
And inside it with the people made of molasses
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
You been hurt so many times
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
To sharpen the senses
What good am I if I say foolish things
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
We living in times when men commit crimes
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
Her window's wide open, African trees
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Glide across the lonely years
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
The empty-handed painter from your streets
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
That it's you and no one else that owns
As friends and other strangers
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
Six-time losers
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
To the cutting of fences
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
"Not me," said the man whose fists
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Mama, you know, awaits the news
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
I was thinking of a series of dreams
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
I try to tell it like it is
Seven days
People on the platforms
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Six-time users
Romantic facts of musketeers
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
The cowboy angel rides
True love can make a blade of grass
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
I'm on the pavement
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
You used to laugh about
By the way, that's a cute hat
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
But, then again, there's only one I've met
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
You used to laugh–make fun about
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Oh, everybody's got to eat
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
Yet you know there is no answer fit
Plants in the bed, but
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
It don't take too long to find out
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
That might be all that you got
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
In the precious winds they rot
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Johnny's in the basement
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Well, early in the morning till late at night
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Wait for the morning light
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
I got into the driver's seat
I soon get some rest
The slow one now will later be fast
In the stillness of the midnight
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
They tell me to be discreet
To hold each other tight
Our Father would not like the way that you act
Keep me set apart
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
And, since my feet are now fast
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
But, if the arrow is straight
Talking that the heat put
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Everyone still talks about
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
How many years can a mountain exist
So he never thinks straight
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
And I, in my armor, turning about
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I think that it's best
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
One more night the moon is shining bright
Everything is always right
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
She seems too far out
You're hearing my heart beat
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
He really wasn't where it's at
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
They tell me revenge is sweet
You don't forget
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
You're gonna get hit
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
Without any doubt
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
He built a fire on Main Street
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Ain't it hard when you discover that
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
One more night I will wait for the light
The slowest now will later be fast
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And the first one now will later be last
How many years can some people exist
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
You are there in the flickering light
There's some people that
With your pockets well protected at last
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
To protect you and defend you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To be alone with you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
It's just crazy being here with you
I'll remember you
I can be just like you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Don't it always go to show
Yes, I'd sure like to know
But sooner or later one of us must know
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Sooner or later one of us must know
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Ring them bells for the chosen few
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Don't it always a-go to show
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
He been living there three years now
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
The only one I know
With only you in view
It only goes to show
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Well, I'd sure like to know
I'd sure like to know
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Well, I'm walking down the highway
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
She smiles, walks the other way
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
From phony jealousy
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
My mind weaves a symphony
And for His love they took His life away
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
For them that think death's honesty
So I run down most hurriedly
My ears hear a symphony
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
We banged the drum slowly
The same thing I would want today
But you can never steal away
Or if you just want some company
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
That I was just a puppet in a play
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Is worth more than I could pay
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
So they took him to the infirmary
I did not do it harmfully
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
If I don't take the chance to try
The Spanish-American War had its day
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
And it's up to you to say
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
Though I'd never say
Don't you tell Henry
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
And the only tune my guitar could play
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
But I wish there was something you would do or say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
So, I'm walking down your highway
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
For them that must obey authority
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
No, you'll not now or no other day
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
She puts it to me plain as day
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
She knocked upon it anyway
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
Spouted out that liberty
For them that think death––death's honesty
That I done it the way
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And I'm leaving every day to run away
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Went to the doctor the very next day
I send you all my money
A cock is crowing far away
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Maggie says that many say
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
And the ladies treat me kindly
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
And that which you've given me today
But I can't deny
To those condemned to act accordingly
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
With no other choice except but for to go –
Ha–va–
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
That can win what's a-never been won –
Hang out the whole next day –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Haven't seen her since that night –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Oh, my–
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Havana–gee–
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
How badly they were shocked –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
I'm sure it was not three –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
It can't be this way everywhere –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
As suicide remarks are torn –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Ten thousand miles or more –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
With notions his canoe was laden –
First degree and second degree –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Private reasons – great or small –
Turn, turn, turn again –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
I a-hope you can hear––
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Hava–na–
Without a reply I left by the moon –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
I got no idea what I want –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
You will not hear a laugh –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Disconnect these cables––
I hope that you can hear––
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Leave all the children home –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
To know where you are –
Havanagee–luh–
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Indians camp along her border –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
I long to hold you in the night –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
