I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!
Well!
Yeah, you'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
They got away!
Oh, no!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, yeah!
Good God!
I catch dinosaurs! Make love to Elizabeth Taylor! Catch hell from Richard Burton!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
She makes love like a woman – yes, she does!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
Betty Ross!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
He punched me out!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
They was all over!
Lord, I really miss my baby!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
I got the freight train blues!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
Goodnight!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I ain't different than anyone!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Play that guitar now!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, well!
Yippee!
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Alright!
I wound up with the Dean of Women!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!
I figured they was in my TV set!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Howdy, East Orange!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
You fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Hear my gal call me, God, I got to go!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Then you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I gotta think you're really weird!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Start over!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Lordy, Lord!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
Yeah, man!
Step it up and go, yeah, man!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
She's insane!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Them Reds did it!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
It was the mailman!
Oh, if I could just find you tonight!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Take me down to California, baby!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Oh, yeah!
Yes, come out your window!
Wowee! Pretty scary!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down in the easy chair!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Woo-hoo!
I'm in love with you!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Woo!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Hootenanny television!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
I wanna be yours!
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
68, but says she's 24, ohh!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
Oh, lawdy, mama, got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
Dance!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
I've got a million friends!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Oh!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
How they ever flood my soul!
Dignity never been photographed!
You must think I'm crazy!
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister!
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, I can't believe that you're for real!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
So long, New York!
I've got the freight train blues!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
Thank you!
Alright, now!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
My God, they killed Him!
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
God said, "On Highway 61."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
And pretend that you never have met."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
"What's good for you is good for me,"
From across that lonesome ocean."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
"I've had too much of your company,"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
Come flowing down so free?"
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
Country'll grow."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
We'll both go home together."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
They look as dark as night."
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
For that reason I will have to stay."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
"Is it easy to forget?"
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
You and I'll never know."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
And punched my cigarette."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
The next time you see me coming you better run."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
I didn't see you around."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
I would want again tomorrow."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
I can't find my knees."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
You can't blame us at all."
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Get on your horse and ride away."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
That you must always first forgive them."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Have it on Highway 61."
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
So write to her tenderly."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
It's all for the love of thee."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
And it's all for the love of thee."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
You must know about my debutante."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
You can't blame me at all."
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
And hung on a willow tree."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
I'll apply them all to thee."
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
Where you and I will unite."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
Will mourn for your return."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
And have it on Highway 61."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
Has kindly assisted me home."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
I'm weeping for my babies three."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
Would kill a little bird like me."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Take it on down to Highway 61."
We'll both go off together."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
But I know what you want."
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."

You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
"That way down Highway 61."
"One of us had better call up the cops."

And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."

What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."

I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Don't wear sandals,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
But I know that he don't talk,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Get back, write Braille,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
And to come every time you call,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
Rabbit running down across the road,
All that and more and then some,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Hmm, see what you can do,
All you can do is do what you must,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
They say everything can be replaced,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
I've been saved – well, alright,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Grandpa died last week,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
You have given me life to live,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Like as not, it's better so,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
Can't find what I need,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
I tried to reach you, honey,
The joint is jumping,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
The wind blowing the snow around,
And point away from the past,
I'm so glad,
I ain't looking to block you up,
Well, come all without, come all within,
It's alright,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Honey, just for you to climb,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Stone you and say good luck,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Thieving in the alley,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
All the silver, all the gold,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Why she did go,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Don't tie no bows,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Try hard, get barred,
The man in the trench-coat,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
You can raise up your right hand,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
The wind howls like a hammer,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
To be so useless and all,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
She would have married me,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
As human gods aim for their mark,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
That can do what's never been done,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
You have given all there is to give,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
God knows it's terrifying,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Someone to close his heart,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
The sky too is folding over you,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
You have laid down Your life for me,
Three angels up above the street,
You gotta look some other place,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
He is centuries old,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Far away from it all,
How many a year has passed and gone,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Eh, in somebody's room,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
Like you never did before,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Don't let her see that you need her,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
The carpet too is moving under you,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
But, if I can save you any time,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Tell me that you love me only,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Without a dream in my heart,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
I long to see you in the morning light,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
Yet every distance is not near,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
We've killed each one,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Want you,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
The only son of God Almighty,
And I'm in the shade,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Baby, please stop crying,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
I'm never, never far from home,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Ye shall be changed,
The day would surely have to break,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I got two white horses following me,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I went into the red, went into the black,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
The human mind can only stand so much,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
Too serious to fool,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
Get born, keep warm,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
From their fates try to resign,
In the image of someone you used to know,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
With a killer's pride, security,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Broken idols, broken heads,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Carved next to his name,
God knows there's a heaven,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
You got something I want plenty of,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
No, nothing was delivered,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
If ever I prove false to you,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Couldn't even see the floor,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
And I––I walk out on my own,
I won't have my nature way,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
The day you quit me, baby,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
I got no place left to turn,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
Equality, liberty,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Simplify you, classify you,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Had no one to go my bail,
Going home,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
It's rising up above my head,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
In the ruins of your balcony,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
Just don't know what to do,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
A man with a badge skips by,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Each one playing a horn,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
He been around the world and back again,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
I know I can't win,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
She leave by the other and roam,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
In the great unknown,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
They run a brick and tile company,
God don't call it treason,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
We live and we die, we know not why,
We'll fly the night away,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
Got me a secret membership card,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
Laying low,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
It's not aimed at anyone,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Don't let her know,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
With the juice running down my leg,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
But I'm pressing on,
Father who build the mountain so high,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
And also by his feet,
At ships with tattooed sails,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Well, I'm so glad,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
True love, they've been without it,
To know how much I really care,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
You had enough of hatred,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Light yourself a candle,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Like a rolling stone,
There's always someone who understands,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
And it's like I ain't here,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
You have given everything to me,
That fired the gun,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
By losers, cheaters,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
I went into the city, into the town,
With no direction home,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
There she come, now, down my way,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I had a dream about you, baby,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
That long, black train is pulling down,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Oh, singing just for you,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Give what I got until I got no more,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Looking 'bout the government,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
"Come along and take a trip,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
But the bottles are done,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
First degree and second degree,
She's opened up a happy home,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Speaking to some French girl,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
In the little church a-this side of town,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
That must be what it's all about,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
In one the surface was frozen,
Where the neon madmen climb,
To find out if she's talked,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Like a complete unknown,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Thinking about the government,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Resent him to the bone,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
I'd only have to stay,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Well, I may just swear,
People carry roses,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
They say every man need protection,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Now, won't you tell me true,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
My arms and legs were broken,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Poor boy dressed in black,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
I went down to scrub and rub,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
You need something to open up a new door,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
The Communists was a-coming around,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
I got a bird that whistles,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Went back home to the yard,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
And there's two white horses following me,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
Want you so bad,
You're beautiful beyond words,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
But he's the property of Jesus,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
You'll be doing society a favor,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Father of night, father of day,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
He's young and on fire,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Father of black, father of white,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
On this new morning, new morning,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
You find God in the church of your choice,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Without ideals or violence,
For she ain't the same,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
To protect his white skin,
When she lays upon the grass,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
You to me were true,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
To have––be on your own,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
Looking for a new fool,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Waiting for the trains,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
I can make it through,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Hmm, I can make it through,
Made of silver or of golden,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
The winter would hold no spring,
I'm going out of my mind,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Trust yourself,
Mixing up the medicine,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Poor boy never say die,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
When the night comes falling,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
And she aches just like a woman,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
To be out on your own,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Don't ever try to change me,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
And to come each time you call,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Tell me,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
And I got those worried blues,
But you were gambling for support,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Day you quit me, baby,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
You have explained every mystery,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Love don't have any place,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Strike another match, go start anew,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
A dream about you, baby,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Advertising signs, they con,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
I swung on to my old guitar,
Watching the river flow,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Come on, come on, stick together,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Wasn't making any great connection,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Tell her not to worry,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
Oh, see what you can do,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
That fellow who never blushes,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
I went back home, put on my tie,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Going,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Said I'm pressing on,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
To be alone with you,
I can't understand,
How he died nobody can say,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
In a pine box for all eternity,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
And the point is slick,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I had no one for to go my bail,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
I want my arms around you,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
If today was not a crooked highway,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
He's not selling any alibis,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
Nothing too very scientific,
One by one until there were none,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
First to come in was the flying moth,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
God knows there's a chance,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
If your time to you is worth saving,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
In the darkness of my night,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
In love and with kindness,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
They pass by so silently,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
Loyalty, unity,
She'll surely turn to white,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
You were snow, you were rain,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
I been riding the midnight train,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
The one we can see and can feel,
I bless the day I found you,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Winter would have no spring,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
I get my sweet reward,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
In the end,
Got my mind made up,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
For something that he never done,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Don't matter what you did,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
They don't believe in mercy,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Going, going, gone,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
And I'm back in the rain,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
They tell me every man must fall,
They must bust in early May,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
And I got the worried blues,
I don't care if you analyze me,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
Just then the order came to charge,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
That five walls cannot hide him,
May be living in another country under another name,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Spent my money on you, honey,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I went into the city, went into the town,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Don't let yourself fall,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
And she'll be coming forth,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
For his age he is wise,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
God knows it's outta sight,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
It's really something,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
If you'd see me this way,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
God knows that, when you see it,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Every brain is civilized,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
And furnish me with tape,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
I can finish this alone, honey,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Of ancient history,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
I shall be released,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
But the time ain't tall,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Maybe when we both get sober,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
That you'd have liked me to,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
To be––direction home,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
The air is getting hotter,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
If anything is gonna sell,
But, if you want me to,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
Using every angle under the sun,
Stand up straight and tall,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
Watered-down love,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Now you don't talk so loud,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
So I got those worries blues,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Relationships of ownership,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
If not for you,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
I've been around this whole country,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
I never can go because, you know,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
A thousand miles from home,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
While riding on a train going west,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Well, get sick, get well,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Face full of black soot,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
To keep up his hate,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
Hang around the ink-well,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Living in the land of Nod,
Corrina, Corrina,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
God knows how to make it flow,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
I'd be sad and blue,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Come all without, come all within,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
Or select you or dissect you,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
Stone you just like they said they would,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
They took a clean-cut kid,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
You have given me eyes to see,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
You better duck down the alleyway,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
When I seen him lose control,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
For all intended purposes,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
King of the streets, child of clay,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
A true love of mine,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Aim well, my little one,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
You got to serve somebody,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
Keep me where you are,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
True love of mine,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
If she ain't feeling well,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Serve somebody,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Like some mystery,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
All the tired horses in the sun,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
The light I never knowed,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Love that's pure no accident,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
They say that every man must fall,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
Strangers all give me the news,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
But it would not be new,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Don't know what to do without it,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Searching high, searching low,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Father of air and father of trees,
I try my best to be just like I am,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
If you must cling to someone,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Yes, I'm so glad,
"Not I," said the referee,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
But it ain't him to blame,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Go melt back in the night,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
God knows it's true,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Each time we meet, love,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Fare thee well but for a while,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
But I would not feel so all alone,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
And comes to a permanent stop,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
And I know what you're thinking of,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
I rambled out of New York town,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
And, if I can save you any time,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
God knows it's a crime,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
But you're doing it again,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
One by one they followed the sun,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
By rivers of blindness,
As the daylight hours do increase,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Better jump down a manhole,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
Precious angel under the sun,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Don't let her see,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Just to know that you are near,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
The country doctor rambles,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
I'm pledging my time to you,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Every nerve is analyzed,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Like a dog on a chain,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
In his anger and his shame,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
It could even be like a myth,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
Made before the foundation of the world,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
In the instant that I preach,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
They keep it all hid,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
I got a wife and five little children,
If you throw it all away,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
They walk among the stately trees,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
Pressing on,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Hazel, you called and I came,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
It always has hit me from below,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
You can hear them tires squeal,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
And on the highway of regret,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
No direction home,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Heart of mine, be still,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
Far away and over the wall,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
One by one they follow the sun,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
I can see the turning of the key,
Go down to the river, babe,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
The night would see me wide awake,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Just as long as you stay with me,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
In the turning of twilight,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
Five by five they tried to survive,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
And they––they look at me and frown,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
Broken lines, broken strings,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Don't let her hear,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
But, if I will save you the time,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
It's like I ain't here,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
I been good,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Just like I did before,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
And your streets are getting empty,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
All I really wanna do,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Just like a rolling stone,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
All them prophets good and gone,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
God knows there's a river,
And come every time you call,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
By users, cheaters,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
I found my world, found my world in you,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
You didn't care that it hurt me,
But he can't be blamed,
You're beautiful to me,
Make you spin or do you in,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Badge out, laid off,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Father of day, father of night,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Out to the windy beach,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
While paupers change possessions,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
Just remember that death is not the end,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
As the present now will later be past,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
They say every man must fall,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
The kingdoms of experience,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
I would not feel so all alone,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
Ain't no going back,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Staying far behind without you,
To your tambourine in time,
And the whole world is on your case,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
God knows when,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Keep a clean nose,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
When all will be well,
Till both of us fell by the way,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
He's the property of Jesus,
Into my own parade,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
In the hills of mystery,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
With his candle lit into the sun,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
But evidently she don't,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
You better chew gum,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
We take great delight in our own company,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
My dear, sweet friend,
You wanna drown love,
Never weak, but always strong,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Watch the river flow,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
With what your fate is going to be,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Forever young, forever young,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
That one doctor cannot save him,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
Private reasons, great or small,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
I thank the Lord,
To shine in through,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
Father of cold and father of heat,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
In the lonely night,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Of this I can't say very much,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
I've been in and out of happiness,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
A worried man with a worried mind,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
You got something better,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Mercury, gravity,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
Where I will always be renewed,
Seven days,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
And I don't want to drag you down,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
And not going through any great extreme,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
They say every man needs protection,
And, although that we're single and free,
I'd already gone the distance,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
That they do not respect in any degree,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
Vanished from my hand,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
God knows it's fragile,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
If'n you don't know by now,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
I wish tonight were here,
I like the way that you move your hips,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
Look away, you rolling river,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
Giving back all of what you owe,
I need a shot of love,
Two by two they step in the dark,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I try my best to be like I am,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Front door shut, back door too,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Don't let me change my heart,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
I'm leaving today,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Oxford Town around the bend,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Read books and repeat quotations,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
To gather flowers constantly,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
You could look at it and weep,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
In the shadows of moonlight,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
In another I witnessed a crime,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
And you know I could never be your own,
Whether you are right or wrong,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
She never does me wrong,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Don't let me drift too far,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
And, if I see the day,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
You broke a heart that loved you,
You will be alright, girl,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Father of loneliness and pain,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
This world is ruled by violence,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Says he's got a bad bill,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
And played the fife lowly,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
It's a price I have to pay,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Only one thing I did wrong,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
My love, she speaks softly,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
But I've been hanging on,
Had a dream about you, baby,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
It's too bad he had to go,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
And it's only that I'm asking,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
We live in a political world,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
I went down where the vultures feed,
God knows there's a purpose,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
They say every man must need protection,
One summer's day he came passing by,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
You need something to open your eyes,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Is looking for a new fool,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
Some things are too hot to touch,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
Get dressed, get blessed,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Somewhere down the road some day,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
And rivers that ran through every day,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
At the close of the day,
Honey, I will meet you there,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Not the end, not the end,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Madams light the candles,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And I'm just like that bird,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
You stole her love from me one day,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Don't you tell Henry,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
And gathering storms may arise,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Don't try No Doz,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Six months on the chain gang,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
A million faces at my feet,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
She once was a true love of mine,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
You want watered-down love,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
Who among them would try to impress you,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
They lowered him down as a king,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
To strict party-platform ties,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I got my mind made up,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
Drag you down or drain you down,
And forget my pride,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
And it ain't me, babe,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
I'm going down the river,
Broken threads, broken springs,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
Need a woman all the time,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Every moon is so sanctified,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
How does it feel,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Already the fiesta has begun,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
A hand set the spark,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
For the wise men and the fools,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
That the laws are with him,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
But something has changed,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
The beat is pumping,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
She'll be coming forth,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
You've got to serve somebody,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Socialism, hypnotism,
And every cause that ever I fought,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Is used, it is plain,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Far away in the stormy night,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
People talk over situations,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
And here I sit so patiently,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
But you try with your whole soul,
It was a girl I learned it from,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
To be one your own,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
Name of Martin Luther King,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
I just can't do what I've done before,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
I have no one to meet,
When there is no more,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
But now morning is clear,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
We never much thought we could get very old,
You married young just like your ma,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Look who's back in town,
This situation can only get rougher,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
My woman needs it every day,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
I had so much left to do,
Don't follow leaders,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Yes, I want you so bad,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
More people kept a-piling on,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
So glad,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
And you make love just like a woman,
Don't steal, don't lift,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
I got the worried blues,
As his youth now unfolds,
If I didn't have to guess,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
But ye shall be a-changed,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
My existence led by confusion boats,
My hands can't feel to grip,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
To hang and to lynch,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
This place ain't doing me any good,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
I got those worried blues,
Icicles hanging down,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Drifting too far from shore,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
I'd give you the sky high above,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
May you stay forever young,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Someone to open each and every door,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Friends with you,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Well, I can't understand,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Tears on the letter that I write,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
I'm going back to Colorado,
And the table's full and overflowed,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
To stay closer than any friend,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Ever since I been a child,
And think they're fooling you,
It was from her ship sailing,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
If you'd see me this a-way,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
A complete unknown,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
And, though the line is cut,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
A question in your nerves is lit,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
To be on your own,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
"Not me," said his manager,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Circled by the circus sands,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
I been good while I been waiting,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Three by three they're turning the key,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
Saved,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Try to be a success,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Yes, and I'll go last,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Don't mind the driving rain,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
May be the head of some big TV network,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
You made it there somehow,
People going down to the ground,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Bring the wife and family,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Give you my money, honey,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Gonna serve somebody,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Wintertime in New York town,
Go away from my window,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
I fell down to my bended knees,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Going, going,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Don't let her know that you love her,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
I don't wanna fake you out,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
My limbs are shaking,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
To a solid rock,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
Where life and death are memorized,
For the politician's gain,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
And, if anybody asks me,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
I wish I a-was a magician,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
They say every distance is not near,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I love you, pretty baby,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
You even make love just like a woman,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
People talk of situations,
Father of time and father of dreams,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
He won't do nothing to you,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
She got great big hind legs,
Look out, kid,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
It don't matter what you did,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
But I'm saved,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
So many roads, so much at stake,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Carry the New York Times,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
That her father was going to hang,
And I'm so glad,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Precious father, loving mother,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Stripping away at it all,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Well, well, well,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
The haunted, frightened trees,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Over your senses you have no control,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
But it ain't me, babe,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Eh, see what you can do,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
To be without a home,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Automobile coming into style,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
It hurts me, too,
And give him back the time he's done,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
But, deep inside my heart,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
I'll be on my way,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
I just say no thanks,
Eh, singing just for you,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
We'll go someplace unknown,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Thank You, Lord,
Yesterday is just a memory,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
You can stick your head in the sand,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Stay away from the train line,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
God knows it's a struggle,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
You don't have to feed me,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Heart of mine,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
Trouble,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Is it really any wonder,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I threw it all away,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
The Second World War came to an end,
Searching everywhere I know,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
And she makes love just like a woman,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Oh, watered-down love,
God knows everything,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
Read books, repeat quotations,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
The angels play on their horns all day,
Roll, Willie, roll,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
Joey, Joey,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Courage is a thing of the past,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Oh, Angelina,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
I can change, I swear,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
And ride a horse along the trail,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
Says he's got a bad cough,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Beyond here lies nothing,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
To hide 'neath a hood,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
The path you've endured has been rough,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
God sees it all unfold,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
They––they show me to the door,
But, to remain as friends,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
With his fist in a clinch,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I should have left this town this morning,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
For her to arrive,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
I want you,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Puffing on a big cigar,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
It all seemed so well-timed,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Well, the way I love that woman,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
She said she would always stay,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
Broken switches, broken gates,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
The night passed away so quickly,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
Dream about you, baby,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
And you take just like a woman,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Dust on my face and my cape,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
She's crying like an evil stone,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Under the microscope,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
And may you stay forever young,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
So, never leave me lonely,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Heart of mine, go back home,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
You say my kisses are not like his,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
On the stone that remains,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
Too noble to neglect,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Up and down the block,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
I'm gonna let you pass,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
You'll change your last name, too,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
How he died nobody could say,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
The country music station plays soft,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
You and me, we had completeness,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
My senses have been stripped,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
Who could they get to carry you,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Nothing was delivered,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
You can run down to the desert,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Memory, ecstasy,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Pick you up every time you fall,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
When you think that you've lost everything,
I once held her in my arms,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
I just keep pressing on,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
Ooh, watered-down love,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
I think we better talk this over,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
God don't call it wrong,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
May be an actor in a plot,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
My love, she speaks like silence,
See you fly or watch you die,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Every head is so dignified,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
The midnight rain follows the train,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
I can't be good, baby,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Well, I don't mind dying,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
She said she would never forget,
The sky too is folding under you,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
God knows you've got to weep,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
It always means so much,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Without your sweet love,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
And, on their promises of paradise,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Don't let her see where you're going,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
Never did feel this way before,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
When I was in Missouri,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
Loneliness, tenderness,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
I just don't know what to do,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
China doll, alcohol,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
Better jump down the manhole,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Without a love of my own,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
Or have done something wrong,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Over the hills and far away,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
I've been all around the world, boys,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Who will promise never to part,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
You were striped, you were plain,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
So unknown,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
It was you who came right through,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
New morning,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
And joined the John Birch Society,
I want you so bad,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Since you've been gone,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
That can do what's a-never been done,
It still ain't me, babe,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Democracy don't rule the world --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
That's where you belong --
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
You're my baby.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
And now people just get uglier and I have no sense of time.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
Hoping you'll come through too.
In the pale moonlight.
But you're not even sure what it is.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Some place so high above this wall.
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
You're gonna need my help someday.
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
For me to return to or chase.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
And all your raging glory.
Food was flying everywhere – I left without my hat.
He supported all his children and all their mothers too.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
Some speak of the future.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
Till your error you clearly learn.
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
'Stead of learning to live, they are learning to die.
You may not see me tomorrow.
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
She pretends like we never have met.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Don't let me down, don't let me down.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
Going through all these things twice.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
He said, "There's a body I'm a-trying to find.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
That's really and truly an American.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
In the border-towns of despair.
You're too hot, darling.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
Madams light the candles.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
With the golden loom.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
I'm going back to end my life down in the Rising Sun.
Lord, I know I can't escape.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
I gotta get a message to my baby, you know, she's not just anyone.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.

Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.
She's in some foreign land.
Fighting every inch of the way.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Using ideas as my maps.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
In my Cadillac.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
Honey, I never would have come.
Trying to create a next world war.
Until I threw it all away.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Down to New Orleans.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
While my conscience explodes.
That's the day you die.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
With all these promises you left for me.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
But you break just like a little girl.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
While evening slips away.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind.
In an oil refinery.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
It's just the old American way.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Fear to bring children into the world.
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
You know the song in my heart.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
68, but says she's 24.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
And may you always a-know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
When he played and we didn't dance.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
It only brings me sorrow.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
No kindred or relative nigh.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.
It's unbelievable the day would finally come.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
Forget the dead you left, they will not follow you.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
A lily-white duck come and swallowed him up, uh-huh.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Crumble into one another.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
I see that stationmaster too.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
Dollar a day's worth.
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
Feel further away than ever before.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
And your golden loom.
And gives it to me for a song.
Our chances really was a million to one.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more and more.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Well, I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss.
It runs both cold and deep.
And discovered her invisible self.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing.
Means another poor boy is underground.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
About an old man that never done wrong.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
Up the steps into the nearest bank.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
From my toes up to my ears.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
He died on the road, he died on the road.
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
My mind is breaking.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
Friends with you.
When I paint my masterpiece.
That which is not permanent don't last.
I got a poison headache, but I feel alright.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
At the end of the trail.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
May you have a strong foundation a-when the winds of changes shift.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
You to hand over your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
And relive my dreams.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
To keep her from the howling winds.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Living down Sonora way.
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
You know, I loved her just the same.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand, and say thanks.
See like me or be like me.
I don't know.
When she's better only time'll tell.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
And wait for succeeding kings.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
I know for a fact he hates Commies 'cause he picketed the movie Exodus.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
To which a scoundrel clings.
I'm going back to New Orleans – my race is almost run.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
And every window made of glass.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
Your voice was all that I heard.
And I need you, ah.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
They seem determined to go all the way.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
Stay in my kitchen, have a [unintelligible], have a picnic in my bathroom.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Somebody just asked me if I've registered to vote.
Go lightly on the ground.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
That brave and devoted band.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Shouting at this lovely girl and commanding her to yield.
On the caboose of the train.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
Said it was a bad dream.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
He found a promoter nearly fell on the floor.
I'm going where I never been before.
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, only place left to go.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Things I never meant nor wished to say.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
You put your eyes in your pocket and you put your nose into the ground.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
As they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Adiós, mi corazón.
She once was a true love of mine.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.
But these to tell what's true.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
And he was a friend of mine.
The hour that the ship comes in.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Than people who are most content.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
Girls like birds fly away.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
And there's no time to think.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
'Bout a funny, old world that's coming along.
Precious memories flood my soul.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
What some people are gonna do for money.
It sure is right on a night like this.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
And the people that confronted him were many.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Nothing done and nothing said.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Eclipses both the sun and moon.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Blues wrapped around my head.
While the law looks the other way.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
Suffering like a fool.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out, but when they will I can only guess.
Baby, baby...
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
With gold and silver in her hand.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
I'll be your baby tonight.
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
You cast your spell and I went under.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
And keep away from pranks.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired.
Father of love and father of rain.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
So the radio didn't work so well.
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
It hurts me, too.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
In fond memory appear.
And clouds cover up the ground.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
Try to avoid the scandals.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
You're a big girl all the way.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
It's tough out there, high water everywhere.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
Oh, Angelina.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Going, going, gone.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Follow her down past the fountain, where they lifted her veil.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
I can walk anytime around the block.
That Johanna's not here.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust and drink the king's health in the morning.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Everything inside is made of stone.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Mine alone.
But no charge held against him could they prove.
Don't trust me to show you the truth when the truth may only be ashes and dust.
She acts like we never met.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Ever since I seen you there.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
And the pearls are from Japan.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
His bedroom window, it's a-made outta bricks.
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
I threw it all away.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
She passes him on the spiral staircase, thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador.
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Is gonna be against the law.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
Only game he could play was Russian roulette.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
Need that woman straight and true.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
Yet there's no one to beat you, no one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
She can't find him anywhere.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
The Germans now too have God on their side.
I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
And I'll rock you too.
I'll only let you down.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
They say times are hard, if you don't believe it, you can just follow your nose.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
I'm sick and tired of the war.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
He was her man, but he done her wrong.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
For she once was a true love of mine.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
To anything I mighta tried.
I got nothing to go back to now.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
Snap out of it, baby. People are jealous of you.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Or put up against the wall.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
And try to avoid the scandals.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
Duality, mortality.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
Ever since we've been apart.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Check to see that no one is escaping Desolation Row.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
And she had left him to die in there.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Wants to get it paid off.
I can't fire them anymore.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
So, darling, you better come through.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Some place so high above the wall.
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
And old Minu––Mister––et paid for his dream.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Put your eyes in your pocket and your nose in the ground.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
To the sin of love's false security.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honor, nor forgive.
When I run outta things to investigate.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
People are expecting a false peace to come.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
Hmm, tell me.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
At not getting their money's worth.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
And pretend that we never have touched.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Poor man looking through painted glass for dignity.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
Just you and me.
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a cop.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her.
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Broken voices on broken phones.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
You got a heart of stone.
Crying out that he was framed.
May you stay forever young.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
And I need you, yeah.
You're on the bottom.
You'll never see me frown.
That set everybody free.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, Little Maggie was made for mine.
Lost time is not found again.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
Baby, let me follow you down.
But I was raised on the other.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
In the days of old and the days of gold, those were days of '49.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.
I think this time we should escape.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
I got a bird that sings.
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
Honey, come and see about me.
Levels my head and eases my mind.
But it was more than I could do.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
You don't have to be afraid.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
So they've hired Mr. Garrett, he'll force you to slow down.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
The light I never knowed.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
I don't even know why we come.
Same old rat race, life in the same old cage.
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll and bade it a tedious returning.
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
Carry for you deep down inside.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
Come on, darling.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
He said, "I got a bed for you underneath the stove.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
To reach of your rattling drums.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
And the night blows rainy.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
You were always so close and still within reach.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
I just can't do what I done before.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
That I really did try to get close to you.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Finalize you or advertise you.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
You been rolling your eyes, you been teasing me.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
While I'm in the hall.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
I can't fight them anymore.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
Down along my restless palms.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Reality has always had too many heads.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
Step lightly on the ground.
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Gonna break in the roof, set fire to the place as a parting gift.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
When the night comes falling from the sky.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Hope I don't blow it.
And the mailbox is locked.
Hope you're ready.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
I have heard rumors all over town.
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
I said that.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
We all know for sure that it's real.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
I hope I'm ready.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
Behind a man's brain.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
I'm preaching the word of God, I'm putting out your eyes.
I followed the winding stream.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
He never did know what it was all about.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
Everything is gonna be fine.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
He had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit.
Is just equality in school.
But my heart just won't give in.
Somebody got lucky, but it was an accident.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
When I left my long-time darling, she was standing in the door.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Everybody that was hanging out.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
The captain is down, but still believing that his love will be repaid.
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
They want me for a gambling fight.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
And then unto eternity.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
Because the cops don't need you and, man, they expect the same.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Greenwich Village.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
All my connections too.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they'll be coming for you.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
That last night I was with.
And then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
Keeping away from the women, I'm giving 'em a-lots of room.
The place that I started from.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
I needed somebody to talk to.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Is tell me that it isn't true.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
I would only let you down.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
You know, there's some things that you put out, it's gonna come back on you.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
It always does when you're with me.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
Now, your dancing child with his Chinese suit, he spoke to me, I took his flute.
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
He could die happily ever after.
Join the army if you fail.
If you throw it all away.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
He's had twenty-seven children, yet he's never had a wife.
A foreign sound to your ear.
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
My heart is telling me I love you still.
For as long as love will last.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
I need every bit of it for the places that I go.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
I just can't keep from crying.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
Each one of 'em got a fireproof floor.
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.
For, when you pull that dead man's hand, your gambling days are up.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
I froze right to the bone.
It's indescribable, it can drive you to drink.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
Mortality, reality.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
But all I see are dark eyes.
With the glory that is to be.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
If you just let me come home with you.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
And light on your right knee.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
You only got ten.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Neighborhood bully.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Intending no harm, but meant to pass by for it being on Christmas morning.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your aeroplane.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
To live it you had to explode.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.

The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.

This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
I watched them from the distance with the music in my ears.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
Drink up your blood like wine.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
See him at play makes me smile.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
"And light on my right knee.
Today Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
Someone to open each and every door.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
You to me were the best.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
At my window with a broken wing.
Lay your hand upon my head.
He stayed behind the assembly hall. It was there he made his bed.
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.

Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Shut the light, shut the shade.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
I need a shot of love.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
Please let me ride you home.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
At the sorority sisters' home.
And no time to think.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
They stashed them away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Soft as music, light as spring.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.

I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
She said she would always stay.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
While the wind blows high above the tree.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Don't trust me to show you love when my love may be only lust.
Want me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
I'll remember you.
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
And I's left alone with three children.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
I shall be released.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
And ye shall be a-changed.
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
I'm leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
"Depart from me this moment," I told her with my voice.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
Well, you can go back to him any time that you want to.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
And the hoof-beats pound in his brain.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
You never mentioned one time the man who came and died a criminal's death.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true.
Police at your back.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
In the summertime when you were with me.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
And tapestry of rhyme.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
Have fallen from her curls.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Saying wants company.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
I got nothing left to burn.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
He ain't-a got no name.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
Calling out that he's been framed.
I'm sad and lonely too.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
So quickly into autumn.
I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
His mama sure was proud of him.
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
No matter what you think about it, you just won't be able to do without it.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
You are on the bottom.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
You're my honey.
I can't see through it anymore.
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
You can go back to him any time you want to.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
I want you.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
Is what this thing here is for.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
I'm younger than that now.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Its curfew-gull, it glides.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
And make promises by the hours.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
And at home nobody cared what Ira done and the wind did the Indians' dance.
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand.
I was under the dome where nothing is sung, you changed my life.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
Trapped in the heart of it, trying to get away.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
And watch the parking meters.
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
Train, moving with a simple twist of fate.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
There's always some new stranger in the night to lend a sympathetic ear.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Know not what the years may hold.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
Havanageeluh.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
By that soft and shining sea.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
Charmed the heart of a lady.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
Bring that bottle over here.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
Right now I'm having trouble.
If I ride back again.
To find that the judge had never spoken.
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
And you only got ten.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
My heart's in the Highlands, can't see any other way to go.
I was ripping it to shreds when this coast-guard boat went past.
The Phantom of the Opera in the perfect image of a priest.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
What was it you wanted? I ain't keeping score.
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Without a love of my own.
She's 68, but she says she's 54.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
All because his face was brown.
I never saw the man again.
Orders from the D.A.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
His epitaph plain:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Man is opposed to fair play:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Till I come into New York town:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Serve somebody:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
But there's one promise, darling:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Yeah, serve somebody:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
All lies and jest;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Some speak of the future;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
About everybody that was hanging out;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Make promises by the hour;
I find complete love;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Crumble into one another;
So many things that we never will undo;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Had to be held down by big police;

Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Why must you always try to make me over?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Gal, where you been so long?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Before he can hear people cry?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
How does it feel?
What would life be?
Of everything you see?
Am I ready?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Who you thought you were talking to?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
How many compared to yesterday?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
What do you think about that, my friend?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
When he's standing in front of you?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Before he can see the sky?
How come you don't send me no regards?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Poor boy, where you been?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
How could they ever mistake you?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Why and what's the reason for?
Don't you remember making baby love?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
When did you leave heaven?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Does anyone even try?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
And one deserving of affection?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
How many more can they afford?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
For all these earthly things?
Must everybody bow?
What can I do for You?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Before they're forever banned?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Am I still dreaming yet?
How much poison did they inhale?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Where did you lose your wings?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Like a rolling stone?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
So I can know if I'm really real?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Is it rolling, Bob?
What good am I?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
How's everything in heaven?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
What's wrong with you this time?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Across the swamp of time?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Has anybody seen my love?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
To love and follow His direction?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
By golly, what more can I say?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
That too many people have died?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
How can I live for You?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Where did you hide your halo?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Oh, so why not you and me?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
But am I still dreaming yet?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
And how does it feel?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
What else can a poor boy do?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Just like a rolling stone?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
Before you call him a man?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Are you ready?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
How many more without any reward?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can you get back in?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Have they missed you?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Across the swooping plain?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
What can I give to You?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
I seen better times, but who has not?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
How could they let you go?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
Too many people have died?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Can I come home with you?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Why would I want to take your life?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Baby, can't you tell?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
How many paths did they try and fail?
'Cause time was on his side and because I
And because time was on his side and because I
This feeling that I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
Well, the dog collar's from India
You have to pay to get outta
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Just what you had in mind
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Its iron claws attached
How many times can a man turn his head
Many times I've often prayed
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Things would be different the next time we wed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
You used to be so amused
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
But something has changed
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And then you told me later as I apologized
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Standing on the water, casting your bread
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And that even the nobles get properly handled
I had to say something to strike him very weird
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
You try so hard, but you don't understand
And your trouble is you know it too good
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
I thought that it was well-understood
Nothing was delivered
All the sweethearts you can hold
It's something you did
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
So I'll make my stand
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
And things would be different the next time we wed
While some, on principles baptized
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
We live in a political world
I'll always thank the Lord
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
I run right home and I went to bed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Somebody seen him hanging around
The changes I was going through can't even be used
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Now you don't act so––so proud
Then came the warning that was before the flood
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
You used––be so proud
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
To see him obviously framed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
But all that suffering was not to be compared
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Now you don't seem so proud
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
They took a clean-cut kid
He was a clean-cut kid
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Now, whenever I get up and
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
There ain't nothing in this world
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Maybe someday you will understand
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
I want you, baby, just to understand
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
As I stand upon the sand
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
And those whom doom and death had spared
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
For what you sold that's not been received
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
I've been walking around
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
But now something has changed
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
I still can remember the way that you smiled
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
I will not go down under the ground
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
I live in another world
But she ain't gonna find the road
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
And into the path you are hurled
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
Either from the mountains of Madrid
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
By no special friend
Now, a very great man once said
"Equality". I spoke the word
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
She let go of my hand
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Silvio, silver and gold
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Up into some paradise
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
From the start by the rule
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
And I ain't complaining none
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Where I could watch her waltz for free
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
You smiling through the fence at me
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Hunger pays a heavy price
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
So I look like a walking mountain range
You just pick anyone
And the Negro's name
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
What about that millionaire
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
I rode with him in a taxi once
She knows there's no success like failure
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I'm ready for to fade
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
When the rain is blowing in your face
"It's only you that he does crave
Knows there's no success like failure
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
It'll be with me unto the grave
Little did I realize
If dogs run free, why not me
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
It's getting dark, too dark to see
What good am I then to others and me
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Though its shadow's metal badge
How was I to know you'd be the one
"Oh, father, you will surely die
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
When I'm all alone
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
You into thinking you're the one
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
Feel to moan, but unlike before
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
You cut to the core
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Lies that life is black-and-white
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
How many ears must one man have
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
I been wondering all about me
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Remember me to the one who lives there
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Full of hope and desire
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
We see this empty cage now corrode
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
On the rising curve
Mona tried to tell me
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
Everybody's wearing a disguise
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
And never sat once at the head of the table
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
With all memory and fate
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
Why wait any longer for the one you love
And I would send a message
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
"That I might be gone a long, old time
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
From all the plans they do pursue
I can survive and I can endure
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
As he rises to fame
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
But I can get another one
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
I do declare
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
You're not free to belong to me
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
Better stay away from those
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Breaking hearts up and down the line
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Says it's closing time
I'm sure you're the one to blame
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
It's all new to me
Remember me to one who lives there
So I remember every face
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
But I can't say I sympathize
Looking at hands for the lines that were
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
But it won't be over till they clear his name
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
You say you're looking for someone
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
Just pick anyone
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
The crashing waves roll over me
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
The man the authorities came to blame
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
All I feel is heat and flame
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
What's probably got you baffled more
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
To give the special one you seek a chance
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
She plunged him into well water where
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
If dogs run free, then what must be
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
What you're gonna say when you get home
Just what you will say when you get home
A bed that is never mine
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
To show you something you seen before
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
But I feel nothing for their game
And that is that one must always flush out his house
You know, it's not even safe no more
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
Leaving men wholly, totally free
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
When the roses fade
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
And you see why it's so unique to be
From the Golden Gate Bridge
And plenty time for good romance
While them that defend what they cannot see
At dawn my lover comes to me
Should I put them by your gate
Con you into thinking that you're the one
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Taking care of somebody nice
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
You said you'd never compromise
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
I am homeless, come and take me
Maybe someday you will look back and see
They say don't come back no more
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
You could almost think that you're seeing double
That she's the same one
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
And suddenly there appeared before me
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
The cause was there before we came
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
She been gone
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Well, it's all new to me
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Waiting to find out what price
Limited in sex they dare
I don't even notice she gone
Among the lovely people living free
If dogs run free, why not we
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
There were times when I was so lonesome
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
But the dark does die
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
So up she picked her babies three
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
He'll see by his grave
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
Should I leave them by your gate
So, I called up the operator of time
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Everybody sees hisself
Oh, trust yourself
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Trust yourself
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
For your weary toes to be touching
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And the cards are no good that you're holding
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
The order is rapidly fading
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
They're drinking up and walking
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
She rode by night and came by morning
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
If I was with her too long
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
I can hear their hearts a-beating
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
'Cause the battle outside raging
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
For your weary toes to be a-touching
Deceived me into thinking
It's not a bad way to make a living
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
There's nothing in here moving
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Beyond here lies nothing
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
The order is a-rapidly fading
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
I know that you know that I know that you show something
The battle outside raging
Well, I set my monkey on the log
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
Where the time and the tempo drag
But then a whistle will be blowing
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
Look out, the saints are coming through
I have fallen far beneath
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
Then she told us how times were tough
Girls' faces formed the forward path
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And how I know I'll make it through
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
You go north and you go south
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
You turn around to take a final peek
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
But they caught him and they brought him back
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Well, there ain't no going back
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
The man in me will do nearly any task
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
Shoot in the back
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Her voice once and talk
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
I wish she'd unlock
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
How does it feel
He's sure got a lot of gall
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
How many seas must a white dove sail
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
To make all that should be killed to crawl
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Oh, how does it feel
As the last fire-truck from hell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
A-how does it feel
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
Muttering small talk at the wall
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
But among the dead that were left on the hill
He's taught in his school
Then why don't she tell
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
A girl by the whirlpool
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
And if my love is real
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
They ask me how I feel
Ring bar, hard to tell
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
All and all can only fall
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
I chased me a woman up the hill
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
How many seas must the white dove sail
Ring bell, hard to tell
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
"For you cannot relive them
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
But I can hear another drum
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Two eyes took the aim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
So, one morning when the sun was warm
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Now, they asked me to read a poem
And remain as I am
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
You better not chew gum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
As they rode him in custody down to the station
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
And there's no exit in any direction
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
But the post office has been stolen
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
Please don't let on that you knew me when
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
In ceremonies of the horsemen
My love, she's like some raven
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
Uncle Rat went running downtown
How many roads must a man walk down
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
That long, black train is pulling down
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
All their daughters put me down
You need something to make it known
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
The ones that jump on the wagon
But it's hard to think on
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
Why did you trade heaven
Will not be understood as they're spoken
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
A-she takes just like a woman
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
Trying to get a lead on
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Guns and clubs followed him down
Advertising signs that con
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
As you sit on the box you keep him in
But me, I expected it to happen
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Suicide remarks are torn
There was little to say, there was no conversation
For the loser now might be later to win
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
That long, black train is pulling on down
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Well, you fake just like a woman
And the smell of their roses does not remain
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Must meet the dawn
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
And the corner sign
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Poor boy in a red-hot town
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
But all their daughters put me down
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
She got such a sweet disposition
You take just like a woman
The foreign sun, it squints upon
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Somebody new to beat on
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
In the pigpen
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Yes, and someone must explain
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
He got that fortress on the mountain
She takes just like a woman
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I figure maybe we're even
And all their daughters put me down
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
"Not me," said the gambling man
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Their religion of the little ten women
But I swear I see my reflection
And she wakes just like a woman
I don't even care if I ever see her again
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
You don't need a weatherman
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
Out of the shower comes a football man
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
Have died in battle or in vain
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
To my knowledge there's just one man
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
To remember the times when I was your only man
How can the life of such a man
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
From heights that they could not gain
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
And she aches just like a woman
She said that all the railroad men
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
For the loser now will be later to win
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
Well, I'm hanging on
I'll be waiting at the station
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Nothing we can call our own
Darkness at the break of noon
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
And you ache a-just like a woman
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
The next morning she had awoken
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
But the second mother was with the seventh son
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
All I really wanna do
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
All I'd like you to do
There's nothing you can say or do
There is a place you go
Silvio, I gotta go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Every place I wanna go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
How many times must a man look up
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Aladdin and his lamp
The man in the coon-skin cap
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
What good am I while you softly weep
Man in the coon-skin cap
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
I walked down there and ended up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
You heard me saying a prayer for
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
My ship is in the harbor
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
Alone you stand with nobody near
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Still I say her love-words over
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
I close my eyes and I wonder
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
I don't have to go far
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
Never no more do I wonder
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
When only you are near
The wind howls like a hammer
When you whispered in my ear
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
At any moment you could go under
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
I say, "Why you say that for
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
All you boys better run for cover
I could feel a whole lot better
Still I've always kind of missed her
In one I was running and in another
She took him by his long, yellow hair
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
The face of God will appear
Who came here from Cuba's door
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I don't even think about her
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
So, don't fear if you hear
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
For all eternity I think I will remember
But morning is clear
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
The lover who has just walked out your door
Girl by the whirlpool's
You been hurt so many times
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
That it's you and no one else that owns
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
True love can make a blade of grass
The cowboy angel rides
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
I'd gladly confess
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
People carry roses
I try to tell it like it is
And then complains
Six-time losers
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And, though the masters make the rules
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Now, you must provide some answers
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
People on the platforms
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
Glide across the lonely years
They whisper in the wings
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
To sharpen the senses
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
You know that he has no intentions
And the poor white remains
Seven days
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
The empty-handed painter from your streets
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
As friends and other strangers
With a big bouquet of the roses
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
How many deaths will it take till he knows
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
But, though the masters make the rules
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Six-time users
With a fantastic collection of stamps
I let it slip gladly to my friends
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
In the dimestores and bus-stations
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
He's not selling any alibis
You should be made to wear earphones
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Well, the ragman draws circles
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
And so Patty calls the cops
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
We living in times when men commit crimes
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
And I try to harmonize with songs
To the cutting of fences
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Thinking of a series of dreams
Don't follow leaders
You never turned around to see the frowns
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
And tells me of her dreams
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
And your father, to your sister he explains
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Statues made of matchsticks
Her window's wide open, African trees
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
At times I think there are no words
And without further notice asks you how it feels
I was thinking of a series of dreams
You can fall down on your knees
Wants eleven dollar bills
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Romantic facts of musketeers
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
Don't wear sandals
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
What good am I if I say foolish things
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
But still remains
To memorizing politics
And inside it with the people made of molasses
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
I'm gonna let you pass
"Not me," said the man whose fists
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
Good and bad, I define these terms
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
And the princess and the prince discuss
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
He built a fire on Main Street
They tell me to be discreet
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
You don't forget
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
You're hearing my heart beat
I think that it's best
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Oh, everybody's got to eat
To hold each other tight
It don't take too long to find out
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
By the way, that's a cute hat
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
With your pockets well protected at last
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Ain't it hard when you discover that
You're gonna get hit
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
They tell me revenge is sweet
And, since my feet are now fast
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
In the precious winds they rot
You are there in the flickering light
I soon get some rest
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Talking that the heat put
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
And the first one now will later be last
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
There's some people that
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
In the stillness of the midnight
Without any doubt
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Johnny's in the basement
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Everything is always right
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
But, if the arrow is straight
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
You used to laugh–make fun about
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
How many years can some people exist
Well, early in the morning till late at night
And I, in my armor, turning about
One more night the moon is shining bright
Like a corkscrew to my heart
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
Plants in the bed, but
So he never thinks straight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
The slowest now will later be fast
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
I'm on the pavement
Keep me set apart
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
We can hold up a toast if we meet
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
He really wasn't where it's at
I got into the driver's seat
How many years can a mountain exist
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Our Father would not like the way that you act
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
One more night I will wait for the light
Everyone still talks about
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Every new messenger bringing evil report
Wait for the morning light
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
She seems too far out
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
That might be all that you got
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
The slow one now will later be fast
I'm moving after midnight
You used to laugh about
I'll remember you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
It's just crazy being here with you
I can be just like you
And I tell this truth to you
I just might have to come see you
To be alone with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
To protect you and defend you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
He been living there three years now
The only one I know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Ring them bells for the chosen few
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
It only goes to show
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Don't it always go to show
Don't it always a-go to show
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
Now, you're probably wondering by now
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
Down every street there's a window
Sooner or later one of us must know
I'd sure like to know
Well, I'd sure like to know
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
But sooner or later one of us must know
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
If I don't take the chance to try
And the ladies treat me kindly
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Don't you tell Henry
And it's up to you to say
From phony jealousy
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
No, you'll not now or no other day
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
The Spanish-American War had its day
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
But I wish there was something you would do or say
I did not do it harmfully
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
My mind weaves a symphony
So I run down most hurriedly
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
And I'm leaving every day to run away
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
And for His love they took His life away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
She smiles, walks the other way
For them that must obey authority
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
Well, I saw it advertised one day
I send you all my money
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
My ears hear a symphony
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
But you can never steal away
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
So, I'm walking down your highway
A cock is crowing far away
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
Is worth more than I could pay
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
That I done it the way
For them that think death––death's honesty
And that which you've given me today
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
To those condemned to act accordingly
We banged the drum slowly
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Spouted out that liberty
Went to the doctor the very next day
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
For them that think death's honesty
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
The same thing I would want today
That I was just a puppet in a play
She knocked upon it anyway
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Though I'd never say
How many times must the cannon balls fly
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
So they took him to the infirmary
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Or if you just want some company
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
And the only tune my guitar could play
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
But I can't deny
She puts it to me plain as day
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Maggie says that many say
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
I hope that you can hear––
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
I'm sure it was not three –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
You will not hear a laugh –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Disconnect these cables––
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Private reasons – great or small –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Oh, my–
Whispering your secret emotion –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
I a-hope you can hear––
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Havana–gee–
Ten thousand miles or more –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
I got no idea what I want –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
First degree and second degree –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Turn, turn, turn again –
Leave all the children home –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
It can't be this way everywhere –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Indians camp along her border –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
With no other choice except but for to go –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Remember me to one who lives there –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Seven more years I longed to have her –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Hava–na–
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
I long to hold you in the night –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
As suicide remarks are torn –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Hang out the whole next day –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
How badly they were shocked –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
With notions his canoe was laden –
Ha–va–
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
You'd come back and you'd stay –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
To know where you are –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Havanagee–luh–
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Trouble…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
