Watch out so you don't step on me!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
They say "Sing!" while you slave -- I get bored, whoa-ohh!
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
You must think I'm crazy!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Them Reds did it!
My God, they killed Him!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
Good God!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues – oh, ah! Yeah!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
Alright, now!
It was the mailman!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Can't stand pat, swear you gotta step it up and go!

And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Oh, yeah!

I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
Woo!
Bring the whole kids." Yippee!
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
I figured they was in my TV set!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
Goodnight!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
I wanna be yours!

Yes, come out your window!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do, yes, you will!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
So long, New York!
I've got the freight train blues!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
I discovered red stripes in the American flag!
How they ever flood my soul!
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
I got the freight train blues!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Thank you!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Looking for my lo and behold!
They was all over!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!

Oh!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
This place don't make sense to me no more!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
I ain't different than anyone!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Hope I don't find out too much!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
She's insane!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Yeah, man!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
You got more than the blacks, don't complain!
<i>[incoherent]</i> on the avenue, oh, yeah!
Play that guitar now!
Howdy, East Orange!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!
He punched me out!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
She's trying to hide, pretending she don't know me!
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
"Have you seen dignity?"
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
They look as white as snow."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
Love my Blackjack Davey."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
He said, "Tell me about it."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
You won't die, it's not poison!"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
"I've had too much of your company,"
But we were tangled up in blue."
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
I love far better than thee."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Will mourn for your return."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
And it's all for the love of thee."
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Give me some milk or else go home!"
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
You can't blame us at all."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
Where you and I will unite."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
From the place that I'll be landing?"
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
You will not die, it's not poison!"
My soul flew to mansions on high."
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
I'll apply them all to thee."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
And pretend that you never have met."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
I'll endow them onto thee."
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
You can't blame me at all."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
God said, "On Highway 61."
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
I didn't see you around."
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"One of us had better call up the cops."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
But I know what you want."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
Have it on Highway 61."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
On the shores of sunny Italy."
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
It's all for the love of thee."
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
Tangled up in blue."
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
And punched my cigarette."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
I'll see her soon, I know."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
"That way down Highway 61."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
And have it on Highway 61."
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
And hung on a willow tree."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
I can't find my knees."
I'll bring back my lady."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
I would want again tomorrow."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
We'll both go home together."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
Has kindly assisted me home."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
It was destiny, it was God's will."
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
So write to her tenderly."
Oh, to face the cannonball."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
You and I'll never know."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
The price, my dear, is you instead."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
And keep him good company."
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
They look as dark as night."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
From across that lonesome ocean."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
Would kill a little bird like me."
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Come flowing down so free?"
"Is it easy to forget?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
That you must always first forgive them."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Country'll grow."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
We want folksingers here."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
You must know about my debutante."
Get on your horse and ride away."
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
We'll both go off together."
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
Be sixteen come Sunday."
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
It depends on how I'm feeling."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
But I will be back, I will survive,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
On the stone that remains,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Just to know that you are near,
Heart of mine, go back home,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
You can run down to the desert,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
All you can do is do what you must,
Where the neon madmen climb,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
Yesterday is just a memory,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
With a killer's pride, security,
They say every man must fall,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
They––they show me to the door,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
The wind howls like a hammer,
I went back home, put on my tie,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
The haunted, frightened trees,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
Yes, I'm so glad,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Well, come all without, come all within,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
But I was feeling a little bit scattered and your love was all that mattered,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Go down to the river, babe,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
It still ain't me, babe,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
But you were gambling for support,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
Too serious to fool,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
And I don't want to drag you down,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
There she come, now, down my way,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Father of night, father of day,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
She never does me wrong,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Well, there ain't no going back,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Already the fiesta has begun,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
But, if you want me to,
That fellow who never blushes,
Automobile coming into style,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
When she lays upon the grass,
I march in the parade of liberty,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
But it ain't me, babe,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
My senses have been stripped,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
You made it there somehow,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
I ain't looking to block you up,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Front door shut, back door too,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Roll, Willie, roll,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
You came down on me like white thunder,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
I just don't see why I should even care,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
They say every man need protection,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
I'm going down the river,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
I'd already gone the distance,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
You say my kisses are not like his,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
Each time we meet, love,
And not going through any great extreme,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Oh, singing just for you,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
And also by his feet,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
I can see the turning of the key,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
The joint is jumping,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
I just keep pressing on,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
Look away, you rolling river,
Oh, watered-down love,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I want you so bad,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
You could look at it and weep,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
And, although that we're single and free,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
To protect his white skin,
Every nerve is analyzed,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
When there is no more,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
Keep me where you are,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Living in the land of Nod,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
You better duck down the alleyway,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Till both of us fell by the way,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Thank You, Lord,
But you're doing it again,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
"Not I," said the referee,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
See you fly or watch you die,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Far past the frozen leaves,
It's a price I have to pay,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
Can't find what I need,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Had a dream about you, baby,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
I'm going back to Colorado,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
Where life and death are memorized,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
And every cause that ever I fought,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
You need something to open up a new door,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
But, to remain as friends,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Hold me, baby, be near,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
But something has changed,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
In the instant that I preach,
Don't let her know that you love her,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
One summer's day he came passing by,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Winter would have no spring,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
As I travel down life's pathway,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
I got two white horses following me,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
The country music station plays soft,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
God knows there's a chance,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
Try hard, get barred,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
For her to arrive,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
But I know that he don't talk,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
How he died nobody can say,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
And I got the worried blues,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
But I'm saved,
Is looking for a new fool,
Searching everywhere I know,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
God don't call it treason,
Go melt back in the night,
I don't care if you analyze me,
When you think that you've lost everything,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
Oh, Angelina,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Each one playing a horn,
I'd only have to stay,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
God knows that, when you see it,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Whether you are right or wrong,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
Face full of black soot,
Like as not, it's better so,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
I threw it all away,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Oh, see what you can do,
So I got those worries blues,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
You'll change your last name, too,
It always means so much,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
Tell her not to worry,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Only one thing I did wrong,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Love don't have any place,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Tears on the letter that I write,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
The man in the trench-coat,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
New morning,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
And comes to a permanent stop,
And it still ain't me, babe,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
King of the streets, child of clay,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
Get dressed, get blessed,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
Heart of mine, be still,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
Laying low,
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
But you try with your whole soul,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
More people kept a-piling on,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
I don't want to meet your kin,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Friends with you,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
I went out last night to take a little round,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
In one the surface was frozen,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
That must be what it's all about,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
Of ancient history,
Like some mystery,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
I wish tonight were here,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
To your tambourine in time,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Better jump down the manhole,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
Don't let her know,
Never did feel this way before,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
I can't cross the line, you know,
I've been around this whole country,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Not the end, not the end,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
On this new morning, new morning,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
In the hills of mystery,
And, if I can save you any time,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
Well, get sick, get well,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
Tell me that you love me only,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
She'll be coming forth,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
People talk over situations,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
Well, well, well,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
Into my own parade,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
The night passed away so quickly,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
A complete unknown,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
'Cause today I'll be staying here with you,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
Made of silver or of golden,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
It don't matter what you did,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
Love that's pure no accident,
Watching the river flow,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
And you make love just like a woman,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
See her in that very tight skirt,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
Looking for a new fool,
If you'd see me this way,
To gather flowers constantly,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
And she makes love just like a woman,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
It was from her ship sailing,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
Six months on the chain gang,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
I fell down to my bended knees,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
We've killed each one,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Need a woman all the time,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
If she ain't feeling well,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
But he's the property of Jesus,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Human gods aim for their mark,
Take the motherless children off the street,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
To find out if she's talked,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
But, if I will save you the time,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
As his youth now unfolds,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
God knows everything,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
As the daylight hours do increase,
If ever I prove false to you,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
Boys in the street beginning to play,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
When I was in Missouri,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
But it ain't him to blame,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
If your time to you is worth saving,
In the night the grounds was groaning,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
You find God in the church of your choice,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
They keep it all hid,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
When all will be well,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
How many times have you heard someone say,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
The night would see me wide awake,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
I swung on to my old guitar,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Want you,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Broken hands on broken plows,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I can finish this alone, honey,
First degree and second degree,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Don't let me drift too far,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
Using every angle under the sun,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
They walk among the stately trees,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
I'm so glad,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Stand up straight and tall,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Get born, keep warm,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
Icicles hanging down,
Paradise, sacrifice,
I thank the Lord,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
Eh, see what you can do,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
God sees it all unfold,
And you take just like a woman,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
True love, they've been without it,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Ever since I been a child,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
To be on your own,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Maybe when we both get sober,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Dust on my face and my cape,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Why she did go,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
Thieving in the alley,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
In another I witnessed a crime,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
We'll go someplace unknown,
I long to see you in the morning light,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Strike another match, go start anew,
Look who's back in town,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
My love, she speaks like silence,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
But evidently she don't,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
They say every man must need protection,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
To be one your own,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Now, won't you tell me true,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
You've got to serve somebody,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Over your senses you have no control,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Alright, I'm so glad,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
It could even be like a myth,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
They must bust in early May,
And your streets are getting empty,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
You're beautiful to me,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
You were striped, you were plain,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Just as long as you stay with me,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
It hurts me, too,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
And to come each time you call,
People carry roses,
I'm going out of my mind,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Makes no difference where she's been,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Don't let me change my heart,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
Joey, Joey,
In the lonely night,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Out to the windy beach,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Said I'm pressing on,
Two by two they step in the dark,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Like a dog on a chain,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
Adiós, mi corazón,
It always has hit me from below,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Hang around the ink-well,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
Is it really any wonder,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
I had no one for to go my bail,
Saved,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
And give him back the time he's done,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Eh, in somebody's room,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
If not for you,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
And I'm so glad,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I'm pledging my time to you,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
To shine in through,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
I try my best to be just like I am,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
No direction home,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Most of the time it's well understood,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
Corrina, Corrina,
Don't know what to do without it,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
I found my world, found my world in you,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
While paupers change possessions,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Madams light the candles,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
But, if I can save you any time,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
Just like I did before,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
One by one until there were none,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
For the politician's gain,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
She once was a true love of mine,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I got no place left to turn,
Of this I can't say very much,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
And she aches just like a woman,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
Grandpa died last week,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Never weak, but always strong,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
A dream about you, baby,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Oh, in somebody's room,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
To strict party-platform ties,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Ooh, watered-down love,
That long, black train is pulling down,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
In the darkness of my night,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
And the point is slick,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
Carved next to his name,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
Don't matter what you did,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
If you'd see me this a-way,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
Baby, let me follow you down,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Ain't no going back,
Or have done something wrong,
Stripping away at it all,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
The winter would hold no spring,
And it's like I ain't here,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Up and down the block,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Don't tie no bows,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
I just can't beg you anymore,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Stone you when you are young and able,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
This situation can only get rougher,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Stone you just like they said they would,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
I won't let go and I can't let go,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I never can go because, you know,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Some things are too hot to touch,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
To know how much I really care,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Since you've been gone,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Watered-down love,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
In the shadows of moonlight,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
And furnish me with tape,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Ah, get sick, get well,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
To a solid rock,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
We live in a political world,
Don't let her hear,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
You have given everything to me,
Is used, it is plain,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
He's young and on fire,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
Circled by the circus sands,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
God knows there's a heaven,
I want you,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
That the laws are with him,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
And, if I see the day,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
That can do what's a-never been done,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
You will be alright, girl,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Well, I gave you all my money,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Says he's got a bad bill,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
Wintertime in New York town,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
With his fist in a clinch,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Don't mind the driving rain,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
You can stick your head in the sand,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
By users, cheaters,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
I need a shot of love,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
Without your sweet love,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
If I didn't have to guess,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
Don't let her see that you need her,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
But it would not be new,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
Someone to open each and every door,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Every moon is so sanctified,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Trouble,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
Someone to close his heart,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
You married young just like your ma,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
As human gods aim for their mark,
Light yourself a candle,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Over the hills and far away,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
You to me were true,
For all intended purposes,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
First to come in was the flying moth,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
And the sooner you come up with them,
I landed up on the downtown side,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
Aim well, my little one,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
That her father was going to hang,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
If you must cling to someone,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
Father of cold and father of heat,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
That one doctor cannot save him,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Seven days,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
Giving back all of what you owe,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
I once held her in my arms,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
In love and with kindness,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
So many roads, so much at stake,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
And rivers that ran through every day,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Dream about you, baby,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
If anything is gonna sell,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
Couldn't even see the floor,
One by one they follow the sun,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
Going, going,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
And it ain't me, babe,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I have no one to meet,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
A thousand miles from home,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Equality, liberty,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Going home,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
At ships with tattooed sails,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
Baby, please stop crying,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
You better chew gum,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
In the end,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
And ye shall be a-changed,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
And here I sit so patiently,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
I could have left this town by noon,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
Father of day, father of night,
Like a complete unknown,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
My hands didn't touch him none,
If today was not a crooked highway,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
With the juice running down my leg,
To hang and to lynch,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
All the silver, all the gold,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
Hmm, see what you can do,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
I bless the day I found you,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Just then the order came to charge,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
You got to serve somebody,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Well, I'm pressing on,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
I went down to scrub and rub,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
He won't do nothing to you,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
You gotta look some other place,
So, never leave me lonely,
And I'm just like that bird,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
Advertising signs, they con,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
With his candle lit into the sun,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Pick you up every time you fall,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Got my mind made up,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
God knows there's a purpose,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
It's rising up above my head,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Poor boy dressed in black,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
Under the microscope,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
May you stay forever young,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
My love, she speaks softly,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Try to be a success,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I shall be released,
Look out, kid,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
God knows it's a struggle,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
To be so useless and all,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
The day would surely have to break,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
She's opened up a happy home,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
You follow, find yourself at war,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
People talk of situations,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
I've been saved – well, alright,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
Heart of mine,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
It's not aimed at anyone,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Vanished from my hand,
She leave by the other and roam,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
Carry the New York Times,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Yes, I want you so bad,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
Bring the wife and family,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Tell me,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
People going down to the ground,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
We live and we die, we know not why,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
While riding on a train going west,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Stay away from the train line,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
A man with a badge skips by,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
You got something better,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
You have given all there is to give,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Four by four, no illusion for,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
I like the way that you move your hips,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Give what I got until I got no more,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
And think they're fooling you,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
May be living in another country under another name,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
The night blows cold and rainy,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
All that and more and then some,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Simplify you, classify you,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
And may you stay forever young,
I can't understand,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Gonna serve somebody,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
God knows it's outta sight,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
Relationships of ownership,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
Where I will always be renewed,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
You always responded when I needed your help,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
Looking 'bout the government,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
My arms and legs were broken,
Read books and repeat quotations,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Want you so bad,
Loyalty, unity,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Something about you that I can't shake,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
You don't have to feed me,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Nothing too very scientific,
The Second World War came to an end,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I can change, I swear,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
Forever young, forever young,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
I been good,
God knows it's true,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
God knows when,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
But the bottles are done,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
Going,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Get back, write Braille,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
The angels play on their horns all day,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
The light I never knowed,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
The train leaves at half past ten,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
And you know I could never be your own,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
The sky too is folding over you,
They took a clean-cut kid,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
Three angels up above the street,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Badge out, laid off,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Strange things have happened than ever before,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
In a pine box for all eternity,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
I can make it through,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
Mixing up the medicine,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Now you don't talk so loud,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Had no one to go my bail,
To keep up his hate,
Holding his club like he was a king,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
God knows there's a river,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
No, nothing was delivered,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
It's too bad he had to go,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Ye shall be changed,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
In the turning of twilight,
Give you my money, honey,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Go away from my window,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
He been around the world and back again,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Make you spin or do you in,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
They don't believe in mercy,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Come all without, come all within,
The wind blowing the snow around,
To hide 'neath a hood,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
I'm never, never far from home,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
I just don't know what to do,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
The phone's tapped anyway,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
Memory, ecstasy,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
With no direction home,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
Resent him to the bone,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Or select you or dissect you,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I'd be sad and blue,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
Father of air and father of trees,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
Well, the job that you used to have,
In his anger and his shame,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
And they––they look at me and frown,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
You have given me life to live,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
I'm leaving today,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
It's like I ain't here,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
It was you who came right through,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Don't follow leaders,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
I went into the city, into the town,
A million faces at my feet,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
God knows how to make it flow,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
For the wise men and the fools,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
Every head is so dignified,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
You can hear them tires squeal,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Broken idols, broken heads,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
All I really wanna do,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Broken lines, broken strings,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
Somewhere down the road some day,
Spent my money on you, honey,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
And the whole world is on your case,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
And to come every time you call,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I can't be good, baby,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
By the night and been to some place new,
God knows you've got to weep,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
The beat is pumping,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
You were snow, you were rain,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
How many a year has passed and gone,
They pass by so silently,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
I don't care if you feel like me,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
I've been all around the world, boys,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
True love of mine,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
I been good while I been waiting,
I been riding the midnight train,
By losers, cheaters,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
They say every distance is not near,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
I want my arms around you,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Waiting for the trains,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Mercury, gravity,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
Five by five they tried to survive,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Newspapermen eating candy,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You have given me eyes to see,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
A hand set the spark,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
But now morning is clear,
If you throw it all away,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
They tell me every man must fall,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Private reasons, great or small,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Broken threads, broken springs,
In the little church a-this side of town,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
You had enough of hatred,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Without a dream in my heart,
You're beautiful beyond words,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
I got the worried blues,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
You wanna drown love,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
From their fates try to resign,
Name of Martin Luther King,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
China doll, alcohol,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
All them prophets good and gone,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
And I got those worried blues,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Far away from it all,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
One by one they followed the sun,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
May be the head of some big TV network,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
He's not selling any alibis,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
The day you quit me, baby,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
Far away and over the wall,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Going, going, gone,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
Speaking to some French girl,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
If you can't quit your sinning,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Don't let her see,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
She said she would always stay,
Beating for the dead that rise,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
They say that every man must fall,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
I rambled out of New York town,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
Strangers all give me the news,
Wasn't making any great connection,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
Better jump down a manhole,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
And the table's full and overflowed,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
Rabbit running down across the road,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
And come every time you call,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
But I'm pressing on,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
By rivers of blindness,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
I had so much left to do,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
I got a bird that whistles,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
He is centuries old,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
In the great unknown,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
And she'll be coming forth,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
It's alright,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
That you'd have liked me to,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
To be alone with you,
People are crazy, times are strange,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
The carpet too is moving under you,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
I couldn't see where we were going,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Where nothing comes up to the top,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
For something that he never done,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
That they do not respect in any degree,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Broken switches, broken gates,
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
I should have left this town this morning,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Don't try No Doz,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
"Come along and take a trip,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
She got great big hind legs,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
This world is ruled by violence,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Father of minutes, father of days,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
Father of time and father of dreams,
Thinking about the government,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
I've been in and out of happiness,
I got a wife and five little children,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
She would have married me,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
We'll fly the night away,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
God knows it's a crime,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
They say everything can be replaced,
To be out on your own,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
But ye shall be a-changed,
How does it feel,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
My woman's never sitting at home,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
Too noble to neglect,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
They run a brick and tile company,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
You want watered-down love,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
You have explained every mystery,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
And on the highway of regret,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
She'll surely turn to white,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
You broke a heart that loved you,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
A true love of mine,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
That five walls cannot hide him,
He's the property of Jesus,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Without a love of my own,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
My hands can't feel to grip,
Staying far behind without you,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
My limbs are shaking,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Don't let yourself fall,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
But he can't be blamed,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
Beyond here lies nothing,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
And, though the line is cut,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
Searching high, searching low,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Keep a clean nose,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
My dear, sweet friend,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
Three by three they're turning the key,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Serve somebody,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
God knows it's terrifying,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Poor boy never say die,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
The kingdoms of experience,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
You even make love just like a woman,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Hmm, I can make it through,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
And it's only that I'm asking,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Don't wear sandals,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
Got me a secret membership card,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
This place ain't doing me any good,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
You stole her love from me one day,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
I won't have my nature way,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
So unknown,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
And I'm back in the rain,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
And there's two white horses following me,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
You got something I want plenty of,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
I got those worried blues,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
Who could they get to carry you,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
I went into the city, went into the town,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
Come on, come on, stick together,
The only son of God Almighty,
To be without a home,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
God knows it's fragile,
I'd give you the sky high above,
I'm gonna let you pass,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
But, deep inside my heart,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
And point away from the past,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
Every brain is civilized,
As the present now will later be past,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Eh, singing just for you,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Drifting too far from shore,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
I wish I a-was a magician,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
High water rising, rising night and day,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
The country doctor rambles,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
I just say no thanks,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
You and me, we had completeness,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
A handle hid out in the dark,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
My woman needs it every day,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
For his age he is wise,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
But the time ain't tall,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Just don't know what to do,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
To stay closer than any friend,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
Don't ever try to change me,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Don't wanna be a bum,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
We take great delight in our own company,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Trust yourself,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
A question in your nerves is lit,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
Stone you and say good luck,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
The sky too is folding under you,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Like a rolling stone,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
Far away in the stormy night,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Don't let yourself stumble,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Bringing me all of your charms,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I got my mind made up,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
My existence led by confusion boats,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
At the close of the day,
Well, I may just swear,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
And I'm in the shade,
For she ain't the same,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Seem like I been down this way before,
I think we better talk this over,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
When I seen him lose control,
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
The Communists was a-coming around,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
That fired the gun,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
You need something to open your eyes,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
Just like a rolling stone,
Well, I can't understand,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
Well, I'm so glad,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
It was a girl I learned it from,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
And ride a horse along the trail,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
I'll be on my way,
Father who build the mountain so high,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Who will promise never to part,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
And forget my pride,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Went back home to the yard,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
When the night comes falling,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
The one we can see and can feel,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Says he's got a bad cough,
I love you, pretty baby,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
To have––be on your own,
In the image of someone you used to know,
That foreign sound in your ear,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Pressing on,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
There's always someone who understands,
God don't call it wrong,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
To be––direction home,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Well, I been gambling so long,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
And played the fife lowly,
Get jailed, jump bail,
You can raise up your right hand,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Watch the river flow,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Yet every distance is not near,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
Without ideals or violence,
She said she would never forget,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
Hazel, you called and I came,
I don't wanna fake you out,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
We never much thought we could get very old,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
That can do what's never been done,
Courage is a thing of the past,
God knows you ain't pretty,
They lowered him down as a king,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
Precious father, loving mother,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
"Not me," said his manager,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
I try my best to be like I am,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
Day you quit me, baby,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
If'n you don't know by now,
It all seemed so well-timed,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
Never needed to call you my whore,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
I know I can't win,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Like you never did before,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
But people don't live or die, people just float,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
I would not feel so all alone,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
And joined the John Birch Society,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Don't you tell Henry,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
You'll be doing society a favor,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
And, on their promises of paradise,
It's really something,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Oxford Town around the bend,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
They say every man needs protection,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
I get my sweet reward,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
So glad,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
But I've been hanging on,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
And, if anybody asks me,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
And pretend that we never have touched,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Father of black, father of white,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
The man there said he loved my sound,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
The air is getting hotter,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
Precious angel under the sun,
How he died nobody could say,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
With what your fate is going to be,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
Yesterday's just a memory,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
And gathering storms may arise,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Nothing was delivered,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
May be an actor in a plot,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
Democracy don't rule the world --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
That's where you belong --
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
Come over here from over there, girl.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road.
Threw him down in the hole, I put back the cover.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
The hour when the ship comes in.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
With an iron chain around his neck.
Find out something only dead men know.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
Wherever you're a-gambling now nobody knows.
The next day could be your last.
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
Tried to create a next world war.
68, but says he's 24.
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
Rain would gather, too.
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down.
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word.
You can have your cake and eat it too.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, it's making me feel so sad.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
And they're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.
Oh, you got to trust yourself...
Who pick up on his breadcrumb sins.
Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
For I can't help falling in love with you.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
Turned on my record player.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Is what this thing here is for.
Just what this song is all about.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
Then I went back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground.
I's looking around just to see myself.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
Big, white clouds like chariots that swing down low.
The country doctor rambles.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
But don't think twice, it's alright.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move.
For we were the lads who'd a-give them hard clouts and bid them look sharp in the morning.
With all of his traveling, but I'm still on that road.
Looking for the places only they would know.
So I waited all night till the break of day, hoping one of us could get free.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
Where no one will be a stranger to me.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
And I will always be emotionally yours.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
The sooner you can go.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.
She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
Either someone needing mercy or maybe something I've done wrong.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.

All the things that I'm saying and many times more.

In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
New morning.
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.
Few things you find are worthwhile.
Set mosquito on his knee, uh-huh.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.

What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
I hate myself for loving you, but I should get over that.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
It only brings me sorrow.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.
He could die happily ever after.
Where the women can't follow and see what I spend.
And my best friend, my doctor, won't even say what it is I've got.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I know something is changed.
For me to return to or chase.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.

Feel further away than ever before.
My love winks, she does not bother.
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday 'bout the time that the door knob broke.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
Your magnetic movement still captures the minutes I'm in.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
It sure is right on a night like this.
She'll take the dark out of the nighttime and turn the daytime black.

But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
That brave and devoted band.
That must be what it's all about.
I once held her in my arms.
And say you'll always let it be me.
And the people that confronted him were many.
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green.
Take a tip from one who's tried.

'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.

Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.

Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
And all I see are dark eyes.
Broken voices on broken phones.
The holy one called Jesus Christ.
I've still got the scars that the sun did not heal.

And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Trying to read a note somebody wrote 'bout dignity.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Buy you shoes and clothes.
Oh, when the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me.
So many dead-ends, I'm at the edge of the lake.
Setting my dial on the radio, I wish my mother was still alive.
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you the bone.
You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go.
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate.
You ain't gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me.
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
I'm going where I never been before.
But that's alright, baby, you know I always understand.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Sara, Sara, so easy to look at, so hard to define.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
But deep inside my heart I know I can't escape.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
A foreign sound to your ear.
It curls and falls all down her breast.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
To be alone with you.
But the mountains of the past.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
Everything is broken.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.
She once was a true love of mine.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
And you only got ten.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
Some of 'em going down, some of 'em gonna get killed.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
The National Guard stands around his door.
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse.
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue.
You to me were the best.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
We got met with a tear gas bomb.
You won't get it for money.
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
Hmm, tell me.
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
I swear it hurt me more than it coulda hurted her.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
To make me think I'm wrong.
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.
If you throw it all away.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
The night will soon be gone.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
It runs both cold and deep.
But you're back where you belong.
I think this time we should escape.
And there's a slow––there's a slow train coming up around the bend.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
When she's better only time'll tell.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
I got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane.
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need.
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine.
Trying to create a next world war.
I put my fingers against the glass and bowed my head and cried.
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
She's a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser.
I'll remember you.
But she ain't gonna make a move, I guess it must be up to me.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
While my conscience explodes.
And the sun is a-going down upon the sacred cow.
There stood Rita, looking just like Tony Perkins.
I didn't realize how young you were.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
But take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
You discover that you'd just a-be one more person crying.
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
Starlight in the east, you're finally released, you're stranded with nothing to share.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
Sooner or later you're gonna meet them coming down.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
You got my attention, now go 'head, speak.
When my working day's through.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
I can't find nobody so you'll have to do.
But my heart just won't give in.
You find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
It sure feels right on a night like this.
Everything is gonna be fine.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Rain would gather too.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
I was told I was looking good and to have a nice day.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Swords piercing your side, blood and water flowing through the land.
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
And she'll only know he's dead.
They believed me, but they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
About having to be scrounging your next meal.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
And I need you, ah.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
And I'd lie in my bed once again.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
And I've never been too impressed.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from.
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on Black Diamond Bay.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Oh, we toil and toil and, when we die, must fill dishonored graves.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
By that soft and shining sea.
You're bound to fall" – you thought they were all kidding you.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine.
Everybody must get stoned.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
But with the country to where you're going.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
The last radio is playing.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Paths of victory we shall walk.
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.
I just can't see through it anymore.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
Into the narrow lanes where I can't stumble or stay put.
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
Need that woman straight and true.
Chain you down or bring you down.
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot.
I'm not the one you need.
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Well, I'd trade places with any of 'em in a minute if I could.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
And you find out now you're gonna have to get used to it.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers.
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Humility, simplicity.
I'm rolling slow, going where the wild roses grow.
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
I helped her out of a jam, I guess, but I used a little too much force.
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
I'd'a paid the traitor and killed him much later, but that's just the way that I am.
Where teardrops fall.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
If I walk too much farther, my crane's gonna leak.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf.
Not somebody that you play around with much.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
They would not let me be.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
"Oh, tell me, my darling son, tell me what they've done.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Wiggle till it answers, wiggle till it comes.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
"My trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time, it isn't long.
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
Figuring a way to get back home.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
But nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
His enemies say he's on their land.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I spied the fairest damsel that ever did walk in chains.
Nothing done and nothing said.
You know, I loved her just the same.
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Was the boy with the curly hair.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
And then go on home and have my fun.
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand.
In the summertime when you were with me.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
If this is love, then give me more and more and more and more.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
I threw it all away.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
You say you're sorry for telling stories that you know I believe are true.
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk.
She used to love me, but she don't no more.
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.
I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.
With my hat in my hand and my boots on my feet.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Using ideas as my maps.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.
I was dreaming I was sleeping in Rosie's bed.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
Waitress comes over, nobody in the place but me and her.
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes.
Hmm.
Under the midnight moon.
Oh, Angelina.
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
And ye shall be changed.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
It hurts me, too.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
That which is not permanent don't last.
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
And the marshals and cops get the same.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
You're on the bottom.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
I could hold you for a million years to make you feel my love.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
That's the day you die.
Every urge is so satisfied as long as you're with me.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Wondering if she'd changed at all, if her hair was still red.
This is the blind horse that leads you around.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
Step lightly on the ground.
I've seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes and I feel so depressed.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
The lonesome days, they have gone by.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
She showed 'em to the people from next door.
Wishing I'd never got up that morning.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
It was January the thirtieth and everybody was feeling fine.
For that's the way I remember her best.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
I hate bears.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
Sound like it's on a final run.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
You got a heart of stone.
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
When the game finally ended up, the whole darn boat was his.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
If it just don't make me hurts.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Sun don't shine above the ground.
Gun went off a-rootie-toot-toot and Albert fell on the floor.
I can hear my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.
To see that you're madly in love.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
You'll find them both in Grand Canyon, sundown.
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
Soft as music, light as spring.
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
Never been so easy or so slow.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
You break your promise all over the place.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Never will want for money.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
I hope I'm ready.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
Good as I been to you.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep.
Besides it's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.
Come sit by me, don't say a word.
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
And that failure's no success at all.
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
Rita mumbled something 'bout her mother on the hill.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
The hour that the ship comes in.
To this thing called the Bear Mountain Picnic.
But I know that I can't move.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Come on, darling.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Both of their futures so full of dread -- you don't show one.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
Saying wants company.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
When they rode with Villa into Torreón.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
Put me outta doors.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Streets up there're lined with gold.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
The time and the place that we'd part.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years of how his dog and him just traveled all about.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
What you'll say when you get home.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
Well, the–the judge, he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
But these to tell what's true.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
And discovered her invisible self.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
I don't know any more than this.
"I don't call it anything," said Frankie Lee with a smile.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Honey, baby.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
I been in this thing too long.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife and he always lives pleasant and charming.
And they're going out like a dinosaur.
Each one of 'em got seven wives, each one of 'em just out of jail.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
They both rode off together.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
On anything 'cept a simple twist of fate.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
To get you facts if someone attacks your imagination.
And the answer is blowing in the wind.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
'Stead of acting like we never have met.
You have no idea what you do to me.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
You were always so close and still within reach.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
And the pearls are from Japan.
And the dust of rumors covers me.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
I's looking around just to see who was born.
Watch the parking meters.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
Well, I wish I was on some Australian mountain range.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
To a half a day's shift with no reason.
Hear me singing through these tears.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
But it's alright, ma, I can make it.
To kill with no pain.
Honey, I will pay your fare.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
She used to call me "sweet daddy" when I was only a child.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
Finalize you or advertise you.
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
In fond memory appear.
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
You left me standing out in the cold.
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
I never can remember anything that you've said.
If I ride back again.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
Try to bully you, strong arm you, inspire you with fear, it has the opposite effect.
Walking around with no one else.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
With four-and-twenty windows and a woman's face in every one.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes.
Close your eyes, close the door.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Calling out that he's been framed.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone.
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.
Billy, you're so far away from home.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
I know they're not what they seem.
I remember her whispering yet.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Jeep to drive, blood to spill.
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.
My mind is breaking.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Blowing through another no-good town.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.
So quickly into autumn.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
That don't apply no more – all from parts of Paris.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
As the present now will later be past.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
But she had some way of finding them out.
Their breath is as sweet as the dew on the vine.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
When everything I'm saying you can say it just as good.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, long time ago.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
I used to be among the crowd you're in with.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
It was you who understood.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
I said, "No, no, no! I'm a doctor and it's true.
Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
But you break just like a little girl.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare.
For the times, they are a-changing.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Well, the Lord created it, mister, about the same time that He made the earth.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
Yes, for telling all those lies.
I told her I didn't really care, high water everywhere.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.
And I'll go last.
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Just like you've always smiled before.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
But it's not like the sun that used to be.
When I––he built a fire on Main Street and shot it full of holes.
When she returned, little Delia had gone to rest.
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
Four by four they turn it some more.
Far down the street we stray.
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden.
I used to care, but things have changed.
Try to avoid the scandals.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
He's the neighborhood bully.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
He got no place to 'scape to, no place to run.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
In the palace of the Pope.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
And laid his life on the line.
And gives it to me for a song.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
Even the softest touch.
But he sure left here in style.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long, golden locks.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
And no time to think.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
She wanted a whole man, not just a half.
Magic in a magical land.
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Six by six...
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
You remember only 'bout the brass ring, you're forgetting all about the golden rule.
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
Can't see over to the other side.
Tapping [incomprehensible], tapping across your floor.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.
Looking into the lost, forgotten years for dignity.
I'd do it myself, it's not so unreal.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
So give me your hand and say you'll be mine.
Going, going, gone.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
And the flowerpot's from Pakistan.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
68, but says she's 24.
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling a-rain.
Hope you're ready.
Smoking a cheap cigar.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
For tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks.
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
In an oil refinery.
They want me for a gambling fight.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
That she's my little lady and I love her so.
All of us at times, we might work too hard to have it too fast and too much.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Easy to see without looking too far not much is really sacred.
Tell me.
All the people we used to know, they're an illusion to me now.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
I can hear that lonesome whistle blowing.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
To anything I might've tried.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
An innocent man in a living hell.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
I can walk anytime around the block.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her how come.
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
It'll never do, somehow.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Behind a man's brain.
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
'Bout having to be scrounging for your next meal.
And clouds cover up the ground.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
You'd better get that in your head.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Nobility, humility.
He gone north for a while.
That set everybody free.
But I was cruel, I treated her like a fool.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
He not a-busy being born is a-busy dying.
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
That Johanna's not here.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
I can't shoot them anymore.
To know which way the wind blows.
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
You want a watered-down love.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
Until I threw it all away.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Hope that it don't sleet.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Sara, oh, Sara, beautiful lady so dear to my heart.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Saying, "She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
And I was brought up by my brother.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
Supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Mi amor, mi corazón.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
Some place so high above this wall.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
I'd be lost if not for you.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
Whether Judas Iscariot had God on his side.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
In the night the price was paid.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Fear to bring children into the world.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Gal, you're on my mind.
Go find out something only dead men know.
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
Hoping to find one circumstance of dignity.
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals.
You were trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
"Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.

Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
You walk the floor and wonder why with every breath you breathe.
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
Believe me, it ain't no fun.
About an old man that never done wrong.
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
So impossible to even learn the tune.
Throw my ticket in the wind.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
A true love of mine.
And we'll leave this old highway behind.
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Life don't mean a thing.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
I'd just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much.
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
Gone as the season she's taken.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that's hanging on the wall.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I've been somebody else instead.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
You'll do as much for me.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
He stood beneath the silver skies and his heart began to bleed.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Fighting every inch of the way.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
I shall be released.
When I paint my masterpiece.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Duality, mortality.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
I can't fire them anymore.
If you don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You cast your spell and I went under.
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones that put him out to death.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
But it's alright, ma, if I can't please him.
Girls like birds fly away.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.
Things will be alright by and by.
I had no idea what a woman in love would do.
So I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
She ate so much she made us sick, uh-huh.
It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Into the land of the midnight sun.
Into the arms of Judas Priest, which is where he died of thirst.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
I long to reach for you in the night.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
There she goes, my friend, she's a-rolling down at last.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
As if a wedding vow.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
I'm falling in love with you.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
To the sin of love's false security.
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong.
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week.
And guarded them as they fell.
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
She's everything I need and love, but I can't be swayed by that.
A man named Martin Luther King...
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Love my Blackjack Davey.
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.
All because of the color of his skin.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
Meantime life outside goes on all around you.
'Bout the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.
At not getting their money's worth.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
Madmen oppose him, your kindness throws him, to survive it you play deaf and dumb.
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Without this love that we call ours.
I believe I'm fixing to die.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
But I was raised on the other.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it just a-wasn't enough to change my heart.
Mama, you are on my mind.
Got their noses to the grindstones.
Charm the whistle off an evening train.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Don't remember one thing more.
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you free.
"It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
Oh, the country was young with God on its side.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
With all of them ladies, you know, he's the––lonely still.
Neighborhood bully.
You know, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
Her profession is her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
"Till the flesh rots off your bones.
Or inspect you or reject you.
That I really did try to get close to you.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
A-lord, protect my child.
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
I left all my dreams and hopes buried under tobacco leaves.
It was all over by a quarter past.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Then I see the bloody face of Ramón.
I'm a-going where the climate suits my clothes.
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again, you do so at the peril of your life.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Just a little shanty by the railroad track.
It's only people's games that you got to dodge.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread.
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
Or stay all night with thee.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Than people who are most content.
For the wild, unknown country where I could not go wrong.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Over everything which he had made while the mission-bells did toll.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
If you just once drive me outta my mind.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
I'm younger than that now.
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you.
Suffering like a fool.
With a .44 smokeless under my head.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
You only got ten.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still.
Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
When I leave New York, I'll be standing on my feet.
From the little Minnesota town.
Even deep down inside my toilet-bowl.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
But even Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Things should start to get interesting right about now.
Me, I romp and stomp, thankful as I romp.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
And shot it fulla holes.
Heart of mine.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
You're my baby.
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
Could be the Führer, could be the local priest.
She acts like we never met.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
That just struck me kinda funny.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Talking too many people, drinking too many kegs.
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.
Tell me that it isn't true.
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.
Throw my mattress out there too.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
So today I'll be staying here with you.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
I got my dark sunglasses, I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth.
I followed the winding stream.
In the brightness of my day.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
I'm bound to ride that morning railroad.
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
Man there said, "Come back some other day.
"Yes, I guess so," said ma, then she asked me if the clothes were still wet.
Gonna give you back what you wishing on someone else.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
It's unbelievable it go down this way.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Wouldn't've been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
He still waits for me, constant on the sly.
From my toes up to my ears.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
Oh, convey herself away.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
I couldn't see what you could show me.
Mortality, reality.
Eating that obsolete garbage while being so discreet.
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Come on, baby...
You know, that's a lotta money to her.
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
For the saving grace that's over me.
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
I got eight carburetors, boys, I'm using 'em all.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
"Don't point your finger at me.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
Father of love and father of rain.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
Funny way to start a picnic.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
I and I, creation where one's nature neither honor, nor forgive.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
I know a place where there's still something going on.
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go.
And rivers that ran through every day.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
We thought we could sit forever in fun.
He spread his money far and wide to help the sick and poor.
Slowly into autumn.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain.
And split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
You're gonna need my help someday.
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.
For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
Dollar a day's worth.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
For you don't count the dead when God's on your side.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Baby, please come home.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
Mine alone.
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
But it was more than I could do.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Yes, but the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to call my bluff.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
When I picked up his offer, Lord, musta been mad.
Believe me, ain't no lie.
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
Is simply that one should never be where one does not belong.
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
Oh, got my mind made up.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
Your children are so hungry that they don't know how to smile.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can be.
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.
There's no words that need to be said.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
You know the song in my heart.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden.
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Myself, for what I did I cannot be excused.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
With gold and silver in her hand.
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.
Don't fall apart on me tonight.
Leading me, going home.
I can't see through it anymore.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
If you really believe that, you know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose.
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Sara, Sara, radiant jewel, a mystical wife.
He's only a pawn in their game.
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness.
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
In my Cadillac.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
You looked for work and money and you walked a ragged mile.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearned.
They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
It don't matter, anyhow.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
Hoping you'll come through too.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
Put 'em on a boat, send 'em up to Bear Mountain for a picnic.
Wanna thank You, Lord.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think.
So I'll just say "Fare thee well".
It always does when you're with me.
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.
I went to tell everybody, but I could not get across.
He said, "Who's not for me is against me", just so you know where He's coming from.
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity.
From the boat I fish for bullheads, I catch a lot, sometimes too many.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Baby, baby.
He helped her out of a jam, I guess, but he used a little too much force.
Yes, tell me.
You spent your last, lone dollar on seven shotgun shells.
You're bound to fall." You thought they're all kidding you.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
They seem determined to go all the way.
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
For she once was a true love of mine.
It's rough out there, high water everywhere.
He ain't-a got no name.
Waiting on my burying ground.
And I want you to be that woman every time.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
When I'm alone with you.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
I can see that your head has been twisted and fed with worthless foam from the mouth.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
She brought the water jug, uh-huh.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
To think his niece would be a bride, uh-huh.
In this concrete world full of souls.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
Veronica's not here, Mavis just ain't right.
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
I'll be your baby tonight.
Take it on down to give me grow.
Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
Who always was too proud to beg.
Well, our captain, he is dead – died for a maid.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
I got new eyes, everything looks far away.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
That number eleven was closing.

With my suitcase in my hand.

If everything is as hollow as it seems.
And disregards the rest.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.

I'd lie in my bed once again.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
You–when you knew I had some other place to be.
Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.

But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.

Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
Bid farewell forever.
To live it you had to explode.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Until he came up to the spot where Judas Priest did stand.
Sit down here, you can have my chair.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.

Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
Somebody better investigate soon.
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
I got nothing left to burn.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
If you just let me follow you down.
And the sails are spread.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
"Oh, I'm as good as dead!" cried Reilly.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
But I'm not up in the castle, a-honey.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.

Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
Everything is gonna be alright.
She's the one you been wondering about, but there's a-really nothing much to tell.
'Steada acting like we never met.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.

To understand you know too soon that there is no sense in trying.
Honey, because the world done wrong.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.

I crossed that river just to be where you are.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.

Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Yeah, serve somebody:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Till I come into New York town:
But there's one promise, darling:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Man is opposed to fair play:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
His epitaph plain:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Serve somebody:
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Crumble into one another;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Make promises by the hour;
I find complete love;
Had to be held down by big police;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Some speak of the future;
So many things that we never will undo;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
All lies and jest;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Everybody that was hanging out;
About everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;

Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
That too many people have died?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
Across the swooping plain?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
The changes we put on each other's heads?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
How many more without any reward?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Before you call him a man?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
How's everything in heaven?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
Like a rolling stone?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Of everything you see?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
What do you think about that, my friend?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Too many people have died?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Why and what's the reason for?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
How does it feel?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Where did you hide your halo?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Before they're forever banned?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
How could they let you go?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Before it is washed to the sea?
Before he can hear people cry?
Who killed Davey Moore?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
Oh, where are you tonight?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Gal, where you been so long?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Can I come home with you?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
The love that a stranger might receive?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
How many paths did they try and fail?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
For all these earthly things?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Poor boy, where you been?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Who you thought you were talking to?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
How many more can they afford?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
How can I live for You?
What can I give to You?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
To love and follow His direction?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
What's wrong with you this time?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Have they missed you?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
Just what in the world has come over you?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Has anybody seen my love?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Must everybody bow?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
How many compared to yesterday?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Does anyone even try?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Did you respect me for what I did?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
What else can a poor boy do?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Oh, how could you refuse?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
By golly, what more can I say?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How can you say he will haunt you?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
So I can know if I'm really real?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
When he's standing in front of you?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Where did you lose your wings?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Across the swamp of time?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Why must you always try to make me over?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
How long are we gonna be riding?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
But who did I see but the one I love?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
And how does it feel?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Before he can see the sky?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
How come you don't send me no regards?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
What can I do for You?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Are you ready?
Am I ready?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Why would I want to take your life?
What would life be?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
But am I still dreaming yet?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Am I still dreaming yet?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Is it rolling, Bob?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
How much poison did they inhale?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
Baby, can't you tell?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
When did you leave heaven?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
What good am I?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
Does he change the course of rivers?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Can you get back in?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Just like a rolling stone?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
And one deserving of affection?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Oh, so why not you and me?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
How could they ever mistake you?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
She [incomprehensible]
[incomprehensible]
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
Well, the dog collar's from India
It was put together down in Argentina
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
You have to pay to get outta
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
And pensively stood by his tomb
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
I run right home and I went to bed
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
All the sweethearts you can hold
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
There ain't nothing in this world
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
While some, on principles baptized
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
"Equality". I spoke the word
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
And then you told me later as I apologized
You try so hard, but you don't understand
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
If there's a traveller on the road, then let him have my load
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Now, a very great man once said
It's something you did
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
But something has changed
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
I had to say something to strike him very weird
I'll always thank the Lord
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
Now, whenever I get up and
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
And those whom doom and death had spared
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
I want you, baby, just to understand
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
He was a clean-cut kid
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
I will not go down under the ground
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Its iron claws attached
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Standing on the water, casting your bread
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
And into the path you are hurled
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
If there's a traveller on this road, then let him have my load
Just what you had in mind
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
We live in a political world
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Roving gambler, he was very bored
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
I thought that it was well-understood
And your trouble is you know it too good
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
I still can remember the way that you smiled
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
To see him obviously framed
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Silvio, silver and gold
Things would be different the next time we wed
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
For what you sold that's not been received
But all that suffering was not to be compared
But she ain't gonna find the road
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Maybe someday you will understand
They took a clean-cut kid
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
Then came the warning that was before the flood
You used––be so proud
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
Somebody seen him hanging around
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Nothing was delivered
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
The changes I was going through can't even be used
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
By no special friend
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
I've been walking around
But now something has changed
And that even the nobles get properly handled
And things would be different the next time we wed
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
How many times can a man turn his head
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Now you don't act so––so proud
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Now you don't seem so proud
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
He wagged his tail and shook his head
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
I live in another world
Throw my letters in the sand 'cause you got to understand
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
As I stand upon the sand
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
She let go of my hand
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Many times I've often prayed
So I'll make my stand
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
You used to be so amused
When Reilly's daughter got a message
Should I put them by your gate
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
We see this empty cage now corrode
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
Though its shadow's metal badge
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Maybe someday you will look back and see
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
She plunged him into well water where
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
You could almost think that you're seeing double
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
How many ears must one man have
But I feel nothing for their game
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
With all memory and fate
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
She been gone
I do declare
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
If dogs run free, why not we
The man the authorities came to blame
"It's only you that he does crave
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
Limited in sex they dare
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
He'll see by his grave
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
It'll be with me unto the grave
Leaving men wholly, totally free
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
You smiling through the fence at me
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
As he rises to fame
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
You're not free to belong to me
Lies that life is black-and-white
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
You say you're looking for someone
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
Just pick anyone
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
When I'm all alone
Remember me to one who lives there
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
Everybody's wearing a disguise
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
All I feel is heat and flame
I been wondering all about me
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
At dawn my lover comes to me
But the dark does die
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
But I can get another one
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
On the rising curve
From all the plans they do pursue
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
And I ain't complaining none
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
A girl who would murder her own, true love
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
It's all new to me
Little did I realize
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
So I look like a walking mountain range
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
From the start by the rule
You into thinking you're the one
Hunger pays a heavy price
Should I leave them by your gate
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
To show you something you seen before
What good am I then to others and me
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
You know, it's not even safe no more
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
The crashing waves roll over me
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
Why wait any longer for the one you love
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
I can survive and I can endure
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
And her silver-studded phantom cause
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
What's probably got you baffled more
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
I'm sure you're the one to blame
So, I called up the operator of time
While them that defend what they cannot see
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
See the primitive wallflower freeze
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
The cause was there before we came
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
I don't even notice she gone
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
What you're gonna say when you get home
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
Just what you will say when you get home
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
What about that millionaire
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Looking at hands for the lines that were
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
They say don't come back no more
Well, it's all new to me
Up into some paradise
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I am homeless, come and take me
That she's the same one
There were times when I was so lonesome
And I'm just the same as anyone else
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
And suddenly there appeared before me
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
A bed that is never mine
And never sat once at the head of the table
Feel to moan, but unlike before
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
You just pick anyone
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
She knows there's no success like failure
And the Negro's name
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
Con you into thinking that you're the one
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
You said you'd never compromise
From the Golden Gate Bridge
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
How was I to know you'd be the one
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
"That I might be gone a long, old time
And you see why it's so unique to be
And plenty time for good romance
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
"Oh, father, you will surely die
You cut to the core
Knows there's no success like failure
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Says it's closing time
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
I'm ready for to fade
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
Among the lovely people living free
And that is that one must always flush out his house
I rode with him in a taxi once
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
If dogs run free, why not me
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
Where I could watch her waltz for free
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
Mona tried to tell me
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
When the roses fade
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
So up she picked her babies three
But I can't say I sympathize
To give the special one you seek a chance
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
When the rain is blowing in your face
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
So I remember every face
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Taking care of somebody nice
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Waiting to find out what price
Remember me to the one who lives there
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
And I would send a message
Better stay away from those
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
If dogs run free, then what must be
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Full of hope and desire
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
I know that you know that I know that you show something
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
Early in the morning, early in the morning
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
And there's no telling who that it's naming
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Where the time and the tempo drag
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
For your weary toes to be a-touching
If I was with her too long
But then a whistle will be blowing
What am I saying? What am I knowing
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
There's nothing in here moving
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Well, I set my monkey on the log
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
Deceived me into thinking
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
The battle outside raging
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
They're drinking up and walking
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
For your weary toes to be touching
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
And the cards are no good that you're holding
It's not a bad way to make a living
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
Beyond here lies nothing
The order is a-rapidly fading
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
The order is rapidly fading
She rode by night and came by morning
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
'Cause the battle outside raging
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
And how I know I'll make it through
Look out, the saints are coming through
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
Then she told us how times were tough
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
You go north and you go south
I have fallen far beneath
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
The man in me will do nearly any task
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
You turn around to take a final peek
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
But they caught him and they brought him back
Shoot in the back
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Well, there ain't no going back
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
I wish she'd unlock
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Her voice once and talk
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
A girl by the whirlpool
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
He's taught in his school
I chased me a woman up the hill
Ring bell, hard to tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Well, if I die on top of the hill
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
Ring bar, hard to tell
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
He's sure got a lot of gall
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
How many seas must a white dove sail
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
And if my love is real
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Then why don't she tell
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Soul to soul our shadows roll
To make all that should be killed to crawl
As the last fire-truck from hell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Muttering small talk at the wall
Oh, how does it feel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
But among the dead that were left on the hill
How does it feel
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
A-how does it feel
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
They ask me how I feel
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
How many seas must the white dove sail
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
All and all can only fall
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
You better not chew gum
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
So, one morning when the sun was warm
Now, they asked me to read a poem
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
But I can hear another drum
Two eyes took the aim
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
"For you cannot relive them
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
And remain as I am
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
Darkness at the break of noon
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
All their daughters put me down
Suicide remarks are torn
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
But the post office has been stolen
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
The ones that jump on the wagon
"Not me," said the gambling man
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
She said that all the railroad men
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
That long, black train is pulling on down
Will not be understood as they're spoken
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
In the pigpen
My love, she's like some raven
The foreign sun, it squints upon
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
And she wakes just like a woman
I'll be waiting at the station
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Why did you trade heaven
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
To remember the times when I was your only man
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
And you ache a-just like a woman
You need something to make it known
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
Advertising signs that con
She takes just like a woman
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
For the loser now might be later to win
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
As they rode him in custody down to the station
All lay down their bandanas and complain
She got such a sweet disposition
How many roads must a man walk down
He got that fortress on the mountain
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
But I swear I see my reflection
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
Trying to get a lead on
You take just like a woman
A-she takes just like a woman
And there's no exit in any direction
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
That long, black train is pulling down
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Their religion of the little ten women
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
How can the life of such a man
I figure maybe we're even
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
But it's hard to think on
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
There was little to say, there was no conversation
But all their daughters put me down
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
Somebody new to beat on
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
In ceremonies of the horsemen
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Out of the shower comes a football man
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Well, you fake just like a woman
From heights that they could not gain
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
For the loser now will be later to win
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Yes, and someone must explain
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Guns and clubs followed him down
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
You don't need a weatherman
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Please don't let on that you knew me when
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
To my knowledge there's just one man
Must meet the dawn
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
And all their daughters put me down
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
But me, I expected it to happen
Poor boy in a red-hot town
Nothing we can call our own
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
The next morning she had awoken
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
And she aches just like a woman
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
And the corner sign
Well, I'm hanging on
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And the smell of their roses does not remain
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Have died in battle or in vain
There's nothing you can say or do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
All I really wanna do
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
All I'd like you to do
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
There is a place you go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
Every place I wanna go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Silvio, I gotta go
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
What good am I while you softly weep
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
How many times must a man look up
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Man in the coon-skin cap
The man in the coon-skin cap
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
Aladdin and his lamp
I walked down there and ended up
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
My ship is in the harbor
Still I've always kind of missed her
Never no more do I wonder
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
I don't have to go far
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
I close my eyes and I wonder
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
But morning is clear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
Who came here from Cuba's door
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
The lover who has just walked out your door
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
Alone you stand with nobody near
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
She took him by his long, yellow hair
The wind howls like a hammer
When you whispered in my ear
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
I say, "Why you say that for
So, don't fear if you hear
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
And I don't even think about her
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Still I say her love-words over
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
At any moment you could go under
You heard me saying a prayer for
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
In one I was running and in another
When only you are near
I could feel a whole lot better
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
For I am married to a house carpenter
All you boys better run for cover
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
The face of God will appear
For all eternity I think I will remember
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
What good am I if I say foolish things
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
And tells me of her dreams
At times I think there are no words
Thinking of a series of dreams
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
As friends and other strangers
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
I try to tell it like it is
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
You never turned around to see the frowns
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
With a big bouquet of the roses
And your father, to your sister he explains
People on the platforms
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
Six-time users
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
But, though the masters make the rules
Statues made of matchsticks
To the cutting of fences
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
Seven days
I let it slip gladly to my friends
Six-time losers
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
I'm gonna let you pass
When your mother sends back all your invitations
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Now, you must provide some answers
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
Romantic facts of musketeers
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
People carry roses
The cowboy angel rides
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
I was thinking of a series of dreams
And the poor white remains
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
We living in times when men commit crimes
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
You know that he has no intentions
Well, the ragman draws circles
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
True love can make a blade of grass
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Her window's wide open, African trees
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
Girl by the whirlpool's
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
And, though the masters make the rules
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
Good and bad, I define these terms
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
Wants eleven dollar bills
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
"Not me," said the man whose fists
On the back of the fish truck that loads
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
To memorizing politics
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
And the princess and the prince discuss
He's not selling any alibis
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
They whisper in the wings
But still remains
That it's you and no one else that owns
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
In the dimestores and bus-stations
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
And I try to harmonize with songs
To sharpen the senses
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
The empty-handed painter from your streets
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
You can fall down on your knees
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
Don't follow leaders
And so Patty calls the cops
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
You should be made to wear earphones
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
And then complains
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
I'd gladly confess
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And inside it with the people made of molasses
You been hurt so many times
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Mama, you know, awaits the news
With a fantastic collection of stamps
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
And without further notice asks you how it feels
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
Glide across the lonely years
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Don't wear sandals
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
He built a fire on Main Street
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
The slowest now will later be fast
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
You're gonna get hit
The slow one now will later be fast
By the way, that's a cute hat
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
With your pockets well protected at last
And, since my feet are now fast
How many years can some people exist
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
Everything is always right
They tell me to be discreet
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Keep me set apart
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
You are there in the flickering light
I'm on the pavement
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Ain't it hard when you discover that
Without any doubt
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
She seems too far out
So he never thinks straight
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Every new messenger bringing evil report
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
You used to laugh–make fun about
Well, I finally started thinking straight
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Well, early in the morning till late at night
Someday, everything is gonna be different
Yet you know there is no answer fit
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
And I, in my armor, turning about
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
That might be all that you got
How many years can a mountain exist
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And the first one now will later be last
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
I think that it's best
I'm moving after midnight
You don't forget
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
They tell me revenge is sweet
Wait for the morning light
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
We can hold up a toast if we meet
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Oh, everybody's got to eat
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
To hold each other tight
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
Keep it in your mind and not forget
One more night the moon is shining bright
Plants in the bed, but
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
To keep it in your mind and not forget
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
You're hearing my heart beat
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
In the precious winds they rot
But, if the arrow is straight
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
You used to laugh about
In the stillness of the midnight
There's some people that
It don't take too long to find out
Johnny's in the basement
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
One more night I will wait for the light
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
He really wasn't where it's at
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
I got into the driver's seat
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
I soon get some rest
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
Everyone still talks about
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
Talking that the heat put
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
It's just crazy being here with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
To protect you and defend you
I'll remember you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
To be alone with you
I just might have to come see you
And I tell this truth to you
I can be just like you
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
Ring them bells for the chosen few
It only goes to show
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
Sooner or later one of us must know
Well, I'd sure like to know
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
I'd sure like to know
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
With only you in view
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
He been living there three years now
Don't it always a-go to show
The only one I know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Down every street there's a window
But sooner or later one of us must know
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Don't it always go to show
Now, you're probably wondering by now
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Yes, I'd sure like to know
For them that think death's honesty
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
I did not do it harmfully
He made the bells of freedom ring today
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Someone to get you flowers constantly
And I'm leaving every day to run away
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
How many times must the cannon balls fly
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
And for His love they took His life away
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
To those condemned to act accordingly
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
The Spanish-American War had its day
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
She knocked upon it anyway
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
So I run down most hurriedly
Though I'd never say
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
That I done it the way
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
Maggie says that many say
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
And that which you've given me today
From phony jealousy
Don't you tell Henry
If I don't take the chance to try
The same thing I would want today
I send you all my money
So, I'm walking down your highway
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
A cock is crowing far away
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
And it's up to you to say
Or if you just want some company
We banged the drum slowly
Well, I'm walking down the highway
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
So they took him to the infirmary
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
For them that must obey authority
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Spouted out that liberty
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
My mind weaves a symphony
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
That I was just a puppet in a play
But I wish there was something you would do or say
She puts it to me plain as day
And the only tune my guitar could play
Is worth more than I could pay
No, you'll not now or no other day
Went to the doctor the very next day
Well, I saw it advertised one day
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
She smiles, walks the other way
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
But you can never steal away
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
And the ladies treat me kindly
For them that think death––death's honesty
My ears hear a symphony
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
But I can't deny
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Remember me to one who lives there –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
Havanagee–luh–
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
You will not hear a laugh –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Seven more years I longed to have her –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Without a reply I left by the moon –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
Oh, my–
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
I'm sure it was not three –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
To know where you are –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Ha–va–
Ten thousand miles or more –
I got no idea what I want –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
With notions his canoe was laden –
First degree and second degree –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
It can't be this way everywhere –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
Havana–gee–
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
With no other choice except but for to go –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
Hang out the whole next day –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
Turn, turn, turn again –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Indians camp along her border –
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
Disconnect these cables––
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Whispering your secret emotion –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
How badly they were shocked –
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
As suicide remarks are torn –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Hava–na–
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
I long to hold you in the night –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
Leave all the children home –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
I hope that you can hear––
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
I a-hope you can hear––
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Private reasons – great or small –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
Trouble…
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
