Thank you!
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
Oh, you got to trust yourself, yeah!

Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
He says, "You ain't so bad yourself!" Oh, yeah!
And you say, "What does this mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
I jumped a fallout shelter! I jumped a string bean! I jumped a TV dinner! I jumped a shotgun!
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!
Now step it up and go, yeah, man!
Please, Mrs. Henry, Mrs. Henry, please!
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!

Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!
Hope I don't find out too much!
The National Guard stands around his door, ohh!
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you!
Start over!
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Oh!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, man!
Howdy, East Orange!
"I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
Play that guitar now!
Well, I need a woman, alright!
I said, "You know, they refused Jesus too." He said, "You're not Him!
Under that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Well, you know, it costs more to store the food than it do to give it!
Pressing on – yeah, leading the way!
Pressing on – oh, yes, I am!
All is gone, all is gone! Admit it, take flight!
Can't stand pat, I swear you gotta step it up and go!
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!
So now I'm home investigating myself!
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
How they ever flood my soul!
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens, and hear my sad complaint!
Right now I can't read too good, don't send me no more letters, no!
Oh, yeah!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Right now I cannot read too well, don't send me no more letters, no!
Alright!
I ain't different than anyone!
She takes just like a woman – yes!
I's high-flying, bare-naked, out the window!
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
Oh, oh, are we gonna fly down to the easy chair!
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!
She gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!

That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
Alright, now!
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
And you say, "Oh, my God, what does that mean?" And he screams back, "You're a cow!
Then he fines you every time you slam the door, ohh!
I'm in love with you!
Quite lucky to be alive, though!
Watch out so you don't step on me!
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed!
I've got a million friends!
Dance!

I wanna be yours!
You make love like a woman – yes, you do!
Oh, lawdy, I got 'em in the bottom of my rambling shoes!
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
He punched me out!
We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind!
They was all over!

Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
You must think I'm crazy!
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance! Yeah, dance!
Well!
They talk about a life of brotherly love – show me someone who knows how to live it!

Just don't put your horse in front of your cart," ohh!
Them Reds did it!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!
Gotta step it up and go, yeah, go!

Goodnight!
Oh, oh, we gonna fly down to the easy chair!

Hootenanny television!
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
They got away!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
Oh, no!
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor, ohh!
She's insane!
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
Give a little bit, she took it all!
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
I've got the freight train blues!
Underneath that apple suckling tree, oh, yeah!
Tell the judge I said it was alright, yeah!
Woo!
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
The man says, "Get out of here! I'll tear you limb from limb!"
Oh, to face the cannonball."
I love far better than thee."
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
Say "You're dancing with whom they tell you to or you don't dance at all!"
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life."
I said, "Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?"
He'll say, "Nothing neither 'live nor dead."
"To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea."
The next time you see me coming you better run."
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep."
Others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except a-hatred."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour's getting late."
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck."
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em." He said, "You always help out around here with the chores?"
"Where shall the wedding supper be?"
"Oh, hard times, come again no more."
But sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide."
I said, "I was born at the bottom of a wishing well."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it," said the neighbor, "Just something we're gonna have to forget."
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
Saying, "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
But the judge says, "Mona can't have no bond."
You raise up your head and you ask, "Is this where it is?"
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry!"
"Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet."
"My complexion," she said, " – much too white."
"Alright," said Judas Priest, "I'll see you after a while."
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, "What are you doing here?"
While others say, "Don't hate nothing at all except hatred."
Said, "I got no money." He said, "That ain't necessary."
It's high above on the gallows tree the crows will pick your bones."
She said, "Boy, you talking crazy."
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, you better spit out your plum."
"It's not a house," says Judas Priest. "It's not a house, it's a home."
"Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home."
You say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
They'll stone you and then say, "You are brave,"
I jumped right into line, saying, "I hope that I'm not late,"
To the boss said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
"Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down."
Or from the coast of Barcelona."
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born?"
And say, "Would you like to make a deal?"
God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man."
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
"What's good for you is good for me,"
We'll both go off together."
Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget that you are white."
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
I say, "That's right, bring me some."
Well, she takes the napkin and throws it back and says, "That don't look a thing like me."
He says, "Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
He asked poor Howard, "Where can I go?"
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."
"That way down Highway 61."
We'll both go home together."
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Where you and I will unite."
Got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?"
But we were tangled up in blue."
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?"
I said, "I would if I could, but I don't do sketches from memory."
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
Now, the rain-man gave me two cures, then he said, "Jump right in."
Asks you with a grin, "Are you having a good time?"
He'll say, "Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?"
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buying the place with beads."
I ordered some Suzette. I said, "Could you please make that crepe?"
The price, my dear, is you instead."
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?"
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,"
How is it that you've come to be this way?"
As he came charging down the stairs, saying, "What's that I heard you say?"
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear. You better spit out your plum."
Well, I say, "How would you know and what would it matter anyway?"
Just as papa yelled outside, "Mama wants you to come back in the house and bring them clothes!"
Says, "My advice is not to let the boys in."
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
Screaming, she moans, "I have just been made!"
"Half the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time, but all the people can't be all right all of the time."
Saying, "Throw me something, mister, please."
Take it on down to Highway 61."
He smiled when he saw me coming and he said, "Well, well, well."
Say, "OK, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you'd better leave."
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
Oh, they call me Jack-A-Roe."
My soul flew to mansions on high."
"One of us had better call up the cops."
And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
Saying, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
Don't you and your one true love ever part."
To make your time more easy-passing?"
Are you from heaven descended, abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
"Your presence is obnoxious to me."
Come flowing down so free?"
I went out the other door, this Englishman said "Fab!"
You see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
See somebody naked, you say, "Who's that man?"
He tried to grab the woman's hand, said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand!" She said, "That ain't enough."
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die."
Saying, "Name me somebody that's not a parasite and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."
When nothing you got is US-made?"
I said, "Oh, kind miss, it most certainly does."
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."
While she's out on the balcony where a stranger tells her, "My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
Someone's always yelling, "Turn it down!"
I said, "That's alright, mama, you–you do what you gotta do."
"My complexion," she says, "is much too white."
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning."
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan!"
You say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
You can't blame me at all."
And he just smoked my eyelids and punched my cigarette."
I saw Albert an hour ago with a gal named Alice Fry."
Somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
I said, "Hold it, doc, a World War passed through my brain!"
He said, "Come here and step into the light."
Someone else asked, "What do you care?" Papa said, "Well, just because."
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
And wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
"How good–how good does it feel to be free?"
"Well, my message is he's down the road, stranded in a house."
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."
You must know about my debutante."
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."
Saying, "I dig farmers. Don't shoot me please!"
He said, "My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?"
"Now, take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride, "And temper their edge in the morning!"
She said that for over an hour and I hung up."
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know?"
"That's right," said Judas, "Eternity, though you might call it paradise."
For me there is no other damsel than my blooming, bright star of Belle Isle."
Just tell her kindly, "There is the front door."
Spanish boots of Spanish leather."
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me. "I'm sorry for what she's done."
And she says, "Your débutante just knows what you need, but I know what you want."
But, go on your way accordingly, but know you're not alone."
God said, "No." Abe said, "What?"
What do you mean you can't? Of course you can."
Said, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?"
None of them along the line know what any of it's worth."
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
He said, "Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow."
Judas pointed down the road and said, "Eternity."
Or are you weeping for your babe?"
Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
Rode off with Blackjack Davey."
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
She say, "Who gonna take away his license to kill?"
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and live."
Someone turns and says, "You're in the wrong room, my friend, you'd better hurry up and leave."
See somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well."
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
We want folksingers here."
He hung there from the chandelier, she cried, "Help, there's danger near, please a-open up a-the door!"
"Poison Love", "Red Roses for Blue Lady", and "Memphis in June"
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on."
And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."
He said, "Are you looking for something easy to catch?"
It depends on how I'm feeling."
When she said, "Would you like to take that shower now?"
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep – "Oh, think I'll call it a sheep."
Say, "Alright, I've had enough, what else can you show me?"
Man came to the door, I said, "For whom are you looking?"
They kill babies in the crib and say, "Only the good die young."
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
"I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head."
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier."
And you say, "What's mine?" Someone else says, "Where what is?"
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove."
And hung on a willow tree."
I'll see her soon, I know."
And Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
He writes, "Everything's been returned which was owed"
"I will secretly accept you and together we'll fly south."
Get out of here before I break your bone! I ain't your pop!"
The dealer said, "It's too late now, you can take your money, but I don't know how you'll spend it in the tomb."
Screaming, she moans, "I've just been made!"
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down."
I'll endow them onto thee."
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay or else you'll surely hang."
It say, "It don't count 'less it sell."
You sneak into the window and you say, "Is this where it is?"
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
"What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!"
What's wrong? What's exactly the matter?"
You see someone naked and you say, "Who is that man?"
Get on your horse and ride away."
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o."
I said, "I like Fidel Castro. I think you heard me right."
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars 'cause I drinks a bit."
"You unpatriotic, rotten doctor, Commie rat!"
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
And you say, "For what reason?" And he says, "How?"
He said, "Tell me about it."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane!"
He look straight into the sun and say, "Revenge is mine, huh?"
Well, she says, "You just don't seem,like you do." I said, "You're way wrong."
Said she, "But I don't wish to." Said I, "But you have no choice."
For that reason I will have to stay."
Well, Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
And a cannonball blew my eyes away."
Great, big, furry back and furry hair – "Ah, think I'll call it a bear."
"Come in," she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm."
She said, "Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!"
You will not die, it's not poison!"
She said, "Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
"Same thing my father do I can do likewise."
Just take everything down to Highway 61."
She said, "Where you been?" I said, "No place special."
Says to the madman, "Ain't you cute!"
From the place that I'll be landing?"
He did it in Las Vegas and he can do it here!"
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not."
Have it on Highway 61."
Remember the night you lay––blowed little Sadie down?"
I say, "Tell me what I want." She say, "You probably want hard-boiled eggs."
On the shores of sunny Italy."
Casanova, he's just being punished for going to Desolation Row!"
"Nothing," they say, "He just like to cause war."
And said, "That way down Highway 61."
"Have you heard the news?" he said with a grin, "The Vice President's gone mad!"
Would kill a little bird like me."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour's getting late."
Saying, "Master, tell me why a man must be born again."
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."
She took off her wig, said, "How do I look?"
That you don't touch my daughter and in the morning milk the cows."
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "What's your name?"
Oh, would have this heart of mine."
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
"How old are you, my pretty, little miss? How old are you, my honey?"
With its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords."
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
Saying, "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken!"
And say, "Do you wanna make a deal?"
She'll say, "You got all the time in the world, honey."
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean and sup on thin gruel in the morning."
Oh, would ever suit your mind."
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says, carefully removes his fez, "am I hearing you right?"
She said, "I gave it to you, drink it."
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen!"
Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
You see, you're just like me. I hope you're satisfied."
So write to her tenderly."
"The trial was bad enough, but this is ten times worse."
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree."
"Don't reach out for me," she said, "Can't you see I'm drowning too?"
Saying, "Don't let the boys in."
Be sixteen come Sunday."
She say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
She'll say, "Who take away his license to kill?"
I'll bring back my lady."
I know who you are and what league you play in."
Knocking on the door, I say, "Who is it? Where you from?"
"Oh, they'll flog the poaching outta you down there in Botany Bay."
Abe said, "Where you want this killing done?"
Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
Saying, "Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain."
We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
"I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
"His Master's voice is calling me,"
Tell nothing except who to idolize, and say, "God bless him."
From across that lonesome ocean."
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee."
"My complexion," she said, "is much too white."
Will mourn for your return."
She said, "Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here."
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
God said, "On Highway 61."
Then she says, "I know you're an artist. Draw a picture of me."
You say, "What's mine?" Somebody else says, "Where what is?"
She said, "I don't want nobody see me talking to you,"
And muttered underneath his breath, "Nothing is revealed."
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise."
We'll put 'em on the wall when you get home."
Call down to room service, says, "Send up a room."
She said, "You look different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
I could see that his face looked just like mine."
"Leave her alone! Goddamn you, get out!"
Brighton girls are like the moon."
You can't blame us at all."
Don't wait up for me, a-worry about me when I'm gone."
She said, "Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here."
She says, "Alright, now, go ahead, draw me, I'm staying right here."
And he says, "Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
As she worked on my face till breaking my eyes, then said, "What else you got left?"
"All about them rounders, judge, trying to cut me out."
A woman shot her lover down, murder in the second degree."
Well, she's there, she says, "I'm right here in front of you – or haven't you looked?"
"Well met, well met, my own, true love."
"I'm gonna start my picking right now. Just tell me where you'll be."
Tangled up in blue."
I would want again tomorrow."
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry,"
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic."
And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"
She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
And says, "My advice is to not let the boys in."
He was my man, but he done me wrong."
I'm weeping for my babies three."
And I still do not know what it was that I've done wrong."
Let me tell the second mother this has been done."
"Call the wagon, this man is dead."
You'll say, "What are you made of?"
And punched my cigarette."
You raise up your head, say, "Is this where it is?"
"Have you seen dignity?"
He said, "Come over here, girl, step into the light."
He say, "Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one."
Next time you see me coming you better run."
I say, "Alright, I know, but I don't have my drawing book."
Oh, to see ten thousand fall."
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
Somebody points his finger at you and says, "It's his."
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
Said to the bartender, "Has my loving man been here?"
Saying, "For whose sake did you live? For whose sake did you die?"
You say, "Oh, no, am I here all alone?"
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down."
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night." "Hmm, gee, that's too bad."
God said, "Out on Highway 61."
You see somebody naked and you, you say, "Who is that man?"
You'll say, "What are you afraid of?"
"But we'll climb that hill no matter how steep when we come up to it!"
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
I'll apply them all to thee."
For, if you insult me with one other word, I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
She says, "Which ones have you read then?" I say, "I've read Erica Jong."
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly."
Say, "Prove to me that He's Lord, show me a sign."
Give me some milk or else go home!"
And you say, "What's mine?" And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
"What kind of house is this," he said, "where I have come to roam?"
Man says, "Three dollars." "Alright," I say, "will you take four?"
She said, "You look a-different." I said, "Well, I guess."
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out."
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."
I said, "Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!"
"Death to all those that––who would whimper and cry!"
And says, "Here's your throat back. Thanks for the loan."
And someone turns and says to him, "My friend, you'd better leave."
Sam said, "Tell me quick, man! I got to run."
I'm a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too."
He –– "Yeah, you're right. Let me tell your mother this has been done."
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word "now"
I didn't see you around."
"What should the wedding supper be?"
She gives me a napkin, she say, "You can do it on that."
Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
I said, "What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine."
I said, "That's the best news that I've ever heard."
Was, "Oh, the cruel rain and the wind..."
She say, "You must be joking." I said, "I wish I was."
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull – "Ah, think I'll call it a bull."
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France where we would get shot without warning."
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out, the desk clerk wakes, he begins to shout, "Can you see anything?"
And say, "Do––would you like to––come on now, would you like to come up and make a deal?"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered!"
"I've had too much of your company,"
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"
And keep him good company."
You won't die, it's not poison!"
He said, "What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?"
So I yelled, "I like Fidel Castro and his beard!"
"What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?"
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
Good God Almighty, that stuff ain't real."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute."
She was standing there right beside my chair, said, "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
As great as you are a man, you'll never be greater than yourself."
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o."
"I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours."
And I say, "Aw, come on, now, you know you know about my débutante."
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
Abe said, "Man, you must be putting me on."
"Are you that traveling salesman that I have heard about?"
Love my Blackjack Davey."
And Louis the King said, "Let me think for a minute, son."
They look me squarely in the eye and they say, "Well, all is well."
He saw milk coming out, but he didn't know how – "Ah, think I'll call it a cow."
Romeo, he said to Juliet, "You got a poor complexion. It doesn't give your appearance a very youthful touch."
It's all for the love of thee."
I said, "Could you help me out? I got some friends down the way."
I said, "I got no money, man." He said, "That ain't necessary."
"Are birds free from the chains of the sky-way?"
But I know what you want."
Mr. Bojangles, dance!"
Howard said, "There's only one place I know."
You walk in so politely, you say, "Is this where it is?"
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse."
Man said, "Freddy." I said, "Freddy who?" He said, "Freddy or not, here I come."
And have it on Highway 61."
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see."
And somebody points to you and says, "It's his."
Shes says, "We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come."
Ride off with Blackjack Davey?"
"You'd fail to understand," he said. "Why must you even try?"
Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
I reached up, touched my shirt, and the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
"I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight."
"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know."
Has kindly assisted me home."
What am I giving? What am I taking?"
She said, "You been gone." I said, "That's only natural."
Oh, God said to Abraham, "Kill me a son."
And Sam said, "Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!"
In comes Romeo, he's moaning, "You belong to me, I believe."
God said, "Oh, down Highway 61."
You see somebody naked, you say, "Who is that man?"
"Thought you'd never say hello," she said, "You look like the silent type."
I went up and yelled to him, "Please, please, please!"
Said, "Take me, daddy, to the nearest town."
"The sun not yellow, it's chicken!"
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing."
She said, "You gonna stay?" I said, "If you want me to, yes!"
"You can't open up your mind, boys, to every conceivable point of view."
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me,"
"We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it."
They look as dark as night."
Everybody's shouting, "Which side are you on?"
You hand in a back door to go––"Is this––this where it is?"
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
The tears are all wiped from my eyes."
I can't find my knees."
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Ask you with a grin, "You having a good time?"
And it's all for the love of thee."
You and I'll never know."
You're a soldier of mercy and you're cold and you curse, "He who cannot be trusted must fall."
And you say, "Oh, my God, am I here all alone?"
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."
I said, "Oh, no, no! I've been through this movie before!"
Juliet said back to Romeo, "Why don't you just shove off if it bothers you so much?"
She was standing there in back of my chair, said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
It was destiny, it was God's will."
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big – "Ah, think I'll call it a pig."
"Is it easy to forget?"
"Only a Pawn in Their Game."
He'll say, "Can you repeat what you said?"
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late."
Everybody must give something back for something they get."
I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum, I asked her, "How come?"
If I carry it out, it'll bring a good price."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
Well, if you are, there's a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is Priest."
That you must always first forgive them."
You could die down here, be another accident statistic."
But, you'd better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear."
So let us not talk falsely now, you know, the hour is getting late."
The girls all say, "You're a worn-out star."
And pretend that you never have met."
Says, "Your wife." I said, "She's busy in the kitchen cooking."
"Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's exactly what you get."
They look as white as snow."
And she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit, then she said, "Don't get cute,"
I say, "Yes, I could, but I don't know where my pencil is at."
Country'll grow."
Saying, "Hands up, you Communists!"
'Give me a string bean! I'm a hungry man!'
Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
You seen what happened last time they started.'
'When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock.'
I said, 'Let's go and play Adam and Eve.'
Our loves are gonna grow, ooh-wah, ooh-wah.'
I said, 'Howdy, friend, I guess it's just us two.'
(Oh, my goodness!)
The wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
And you're sick of all this repetition,
Even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
Don't need a shot of whiskey help me be president,
It's a price I have to pay,
I woulda followed you in the door, but I didn't have a ticket stub,
Saying, "Boxing is here to stay,
Oh, my heart is sad 'cause I want you so bad,
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
I met him in a cell in New Orleans – I was down and out,
Steps going down into tattoo land,
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting,
But you changed my life, you came along in a time of strife,
So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor,
When he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized,
Keep all your trouble or give it to the blind,
The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
But this time behind your back, my friend,
I think we oughtta take some of these people,
And give him back the time he's done,
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine,
Ah, but I was so much older then,
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
May your heart always be joyful, may your song always be sung,
There are thousands in the phone booth, thousands at the gate,
Now, his bread, it was corn dodger and his meat you couldn't chaw,
Bringing me all of your charms,
Now, all my fathers, they've gone down,
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
He's made a garden of paradise in the desert sand,
My love, she laughs like the flowers,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
Well, I need a woman [incomprehensible],
And, if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Said it was the land of milk and honey,
Might have drugs at your command, women in a cage,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew-plugs,
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I married Isis on the fifth day of May,
And, if anybody asks me,
Loyalty, unity,
He said, "I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks for drinks and tips,
You'll change your last name, too,
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
City's just a jungle, more games to play,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
By losers, cheaters,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
Well, the neighborhood bully, he's just one man,
And all of your children start to resent you,
Up and down the block,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands with the horses and hounds,
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, I had the worst taste in my mouth that I ever knew,
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
I'd be sad and blue,
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work,
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
Now you don't talk so loud,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak,
How many times have you heard someone say,
Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
There's too many people, too many to recall,
Come, writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Sign on a window says "Lonely",
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
I know I can't win,
Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
She said she would never forget,
And, when it all came crashing down, I was already south,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct,
With a time-rusted compass blade,
You fasten all the triggers for the others to fire,
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charm,
Every lady in the land told him lies,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world locked inside of his leather cup,
Turn to broken-down slums and trash-can alleys,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
They're one day older and a dollar short,
We always did feel the same, we just saw it from a different point of view,
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
I try my best to be just like I am,
You wanna drown love,
Go melt back into the night, babe,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
In the image of someone you used to know,
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed,
Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast,
Me, I'm still heading towards the sun, trying to stay outta the joint,
Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
If you'd see me this way,
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Sky full of fire, pain pouring down,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Exchanging all precious gifts,
I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions at my door,
No time to choose when the truth must die,
I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
Just like bait in the fish's mouth,
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
The next day everybody got up, seeing if the clothes were dry,
I went into the red, went into the black,
Said there's so much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Once there was a man who had no eyes,
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
And the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
Blowing down the backroads, heading south,
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar,
Heart of mine, be still,
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked,
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
And, by any number of bets in the book,
Bring the wife and family,
Well, it must be a holiday, there's nobody around,
Went to the station down in the yard,
Broken switches, broken gates,
Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Don't mind the driving rain,
But, if I will save you the time,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
Well, it may be the devil or it a-may be the Lord,
And it's like I ain't here,
Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
With the juice running down my leg,
Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know,
I couldn't walk, couldn't talk, smell, feel,
Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
They shaved her head, she was torn between Jupiter and Apollo,
People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Shine your light, shine your light on me,
Don't let her see where you're going,
You're gon' quit me, baby,
I have read all their statements and I've not said a word,
Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
Out to the windy beach,
Where a woman, she slaved for sure,
The train leaves at half past ten,
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a ton of lead,
I been a moonshiner for seventeen long years,
Got my mind made up,
I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
But, it ain't me, babe,
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
One more cup of coffee for the road,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Beneath a bare light-bulb the plaster did pound,
The human mind can only stand so much,
Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
You will start out standing, proud to steal her anything she sees,
You can smell the pine-wood burning, you can hear the school-bell ring,
That you'd have liked me to,
Circled by the circus sands,
Need a woman all the time,
And your sky cries water and your drain-pipe's a-pouring,
Who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood,
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burning,
They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
And you can't find it on the golf course,
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
The handmade blade, the child's balloon,
And here I sit so patiently,
A million faces at my feet,
No, but that ain't your game, it ain't your race,
Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
The Second World War came to an end,
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels,
Standing on a corner a-ringing my bell,
If you don't wanna be a bum,
Ring them bells for the time that flies,
It don't matter what you did,
He cocked his rifle and began to shout,
Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes,
Father who taketh the darkness away,
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades and talk with my chambermaid,
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
Please her, please him, buy gifts,
They keep it all hid,
Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
You can mislead a man, you can take a hold of his heart with your eyes,
For all intended purposes,
You're the queen of my flesh, girl, you're my woman, you're my delight,
I have gold chains and the finest I have,
When you think that you've lost everything,
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
The cold-blooded moon, the captain waits above the celebration,
Blowing on down the backroads, heading south,
Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended,
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
A change in the weather is always extreme,
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
To wait for your future like a horse that's gone lame,
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
I was on the battleground, you were home acting proud,
Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
Move in next door, marry my daughter,
Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk,
That man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath,
I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array,
I'm a thousand years old, I'm a generous bomb,
She turned around to look at me as I was a-walking away,
I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies,
People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within,
I met another man who was wounded in hatred,
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
But overlooked a hundred times or more,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Find it on the doorsteps made of papier mâché,
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder,
Everybody, get ready, lift up your glasses and sing,
Yes, I know from darkness dreams are deserted,
You didn't care that it hurt me,
I got a bird that whistles,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar,
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it's making me feel afraid,
Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
And you – and you wish your situation be more drastic,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
I'm going back out 'fore the rain starts falling,
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes,
Sea breeze blowing, there's a hell-hound loose,
Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Purple clover, Queen Anne lace, crimson hair across your face,
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air,
So, sing your praise of progress and of the doom-machine,
I got a craving love for blazing speed, got a hopped-up Mustang Ford,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
So much oppression, can't keep track of it no more,
Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Father of air and father of trees,
Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand,
In another I witnessed a crime,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
Rambling outta the Wild West,
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they'll know that it's for real,
They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes,
To be without a home,
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come,
Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, "Jailer, I can't sleep,
"Not me," said his manager,
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Saying, "Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
Steal a little and they throw you in jail,
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Pick you up every time you fall,
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Stand up straight and tall,
In her honky-tonk lagoon,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Preacher was a-talking, there's a sermon he gave,
I came in from the east with the sun in my eyes,
Stay away from the train line,
The tuxedo that you're wearing, the flower in your lapel,
So unknown,
Spending the time that you borrowed,
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky,
A blanket of newspaper covered his head,
My mind, it was mangled. I ran into the night,
Don't tie no bows,
Whatever the pitch, they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine,
I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
"Go on back to see the gypsy! He can move you from the rear,
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge,
I can write you poems, make a strong man lose his mind,
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France,
When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men,
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
"Strike up the band," they hit it,
He won't do nothing to you,
Now, the bricks, they fall on Grand Street,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
Eh, see what you can do,
He got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names,
Loneliness, tenderness,
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear,
Wiggle till you vomit fire,
Blackjack Davey come a-riding on by, whistling aloud and merry,
Oh, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
I heard some footsteps by the front porch door,
"It's too bad he had to die that night,
Next to come in was a big, black snake, uh-huh,
Drag you down or drain you down,
If you go when the snowflakes storm,
But there's a woman on my block, sitting there in a cold chill,
She walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in,
When he died, I was hoping that it wasn't contagious,
That spot that you're standing, that space that you're sitting,
Well, I don't mind dying,
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Listen to me, pretty baby,
See for me if her hair is hanging long,
Got a magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes,
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Lately I've been having evil dreams, I wake up in a cold, blue lair,
Sign on a door said "No Company Allowed",
I've been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
You have explained every mystery,
With great lawyers you've discussed lepers and crooks,
Tearing through these quarters in the utmost misery,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Don't try No Doz,
This place ain't doing me any good,
I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before,
And your whole world's a-slamming and banging,
A summer breeze is blowing, a squall is setting in,
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass, in the ones I love,
I see the screws break loose, see the devil pounding on tin,
The words fill my head and they fall to the floor,
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly,
If I'd'a thought about it, I never woulda done it, I guess I woulda let it slide,
Crimson flames tied through my ears,
Oh, I already assumed that we're in the felony room,
One summer's day he came passing by,
It's like I ain't here,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
They'll stone you and they'll be back again,
I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
Must be living in the shadow of some kind of evil star,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, boys, I'm going to speak to the crowd,
You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
For one more member, who had business back in town,
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
Well, I was feeling sad and kinda blue,
Now, the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside,
I'm getting up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk a-with the chambermaid,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
The lights on my native land are glowing,
And, as the yellow fog is lifting, the Greek is quickly heading for the second floor,
Everybody's got their heads bowed down,
Feel like I'm drifting, drifting from scene to scene,
I wish I a-was a magician,
To a solid rock,
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches,
Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
Way down in some Tularosa alley,
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget,
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped,
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
There was music in the cafés at night and revolution in the air,
Works up to her britches, up to her neck,
Crowded up above and crowded down below,
Don't wear sandals,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee, uh-huh,
The cavalries charged, then the Indians fell,
There's always someone who understands,
I rambled out of New York town,
Was there somebody looking when you give me that kiss,
Broken dishes, broken parts,
Now, you can run down to the White House,
Well, my pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war,
But me, I'm still on the road, a-heading for another joint,
Poor boy dressed in black,
More people kept a-piling on,
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
And your streetcar visions, which you place on the grass,
And keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne,
I'll buy you rope and twine,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
"Well, I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby,
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin,
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Look on over yonder. Cut the engines, change the sail,
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
Or make your heart pound, but, then again, you know when they're around,
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking,
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
And not going through any great extreme,
Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
The wind howls like a hammer,
Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
I met somebody face-to-face, I had to remove my hat,
And you want somebody you don't have to speak to,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
<i>Hang</i> on and go on out and gas that dog,
He shook his head and then he shook his head, I heard someone ask him, "Please,
And you take just like a woman,
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,
Disillusioned words a-like a-bullets bark,
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
And there's something on your mind that you wanna be saying,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
Though her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
I can follow the path, I can read the signs,
And all the time you're holding the three queens,
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
Well, the medicine man comes, he shuffles inside,
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll,
And you start getting chills and you're jumping from sweat,
So, now as I'm leaving, I'm weary as hell,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle till the moon is blue,
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
"It wasn't me that knocked him down,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Playing around with some sweet señorita,
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl,
Tell my woman I'll see her at home,
That come knocking and tapping in Christmas wrapping,
I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be,
Well, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
If ever I prove false to you,
Let me die in my footsteps before I go down under the ground,
You may call me anything, don't matter what you say,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
And to yourself you sometimes say,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
Don't let her see,
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind,
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
If every little sound just might be thunder,
I had 'em once though, I suppose, to go along with all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all the Christmas Eves,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was laying in bed,
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek,
Warning signs are eve–flashing everywhere, but we pay no heed,
Advertising signs, they con,
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,
They got some beautiful people out there, man,
I see your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
Five by five they tried to survive,
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Well, I'm so glad,
Already the fiesta has begun,
He buys obsolete weapons and he won't be denied,
When all will be well,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
He's dressed up like a squire, bootlegged whiskey in his hand,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
My ears are ringing, ringing like empty shells,
I been hanging on the threads, I been playing it straight,
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
I'm on a rolling river in a jerking boat,
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummers' shore in the good old, golden days,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth,
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound,
Most of the time my head is on straight,
I'm listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
That old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
I've been all around the world, boys,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
I lived with them on Montague Street, in a basement down the stairs,
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after a while",
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you across the stormy sea,
May be hung on the dais, hanging out to dry,
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Father of minutes, father of days,
But I need a woman, it ain't no crime,
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door,
To her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me,
Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
Well, I been gambling so long,
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides, uh-huh,
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea,
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
You will be alright, girl,
Admit that the waters around you have grown,
"Down the corner by the hot dog stand,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
And she makes love just like a woman,
You need something special, alright, you need something special to give you hope,
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass,
Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same,
You don't have to feed me,
The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
And pay the price and not take your advice,
Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
Sheiks walking around like kings, wearing fancy jewels and nose-rings,
It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
One of the boss's hangers-on sometimes comes to call at times you least expect,
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied,
Pressing on – well, I can't turn 'round,
You got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend,
Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind,
Wise men say only fools rush in,
Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Need a woman every night to be with me and lonely as I am,
Nothing that I wouldn't do,
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
Oh, I miss that woman so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Cloak and dagger dangles,
Oh, in somebody's room,
That, no matter how hard you rub,
But there's no way I can compare all them scenes to this affair,
See for me that her hair's hanging down,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
Yes, I never did feel this way before,
Speaking to some French girl,
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,
I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
Broken cutters, broken saws,
Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day,
You've murdered your vanity, burned your sanity for pleasure you must now resist,
Heading out for the old East Coast – Lord knows, he's paid some dues getting through,
There's not much more to be said, it's the top of the end,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
And the lightning's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashing,
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke,
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid,
He that gets hurt will be he who has stalled,
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear,
Don't let her see that you need her,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
Wherever I am welcome is where I will be,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal,
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love,
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
Two by two, into the foggy dew,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Looked up my chimney-hole,
Well, yonder stands Little Maggie with a dram-glass in her hand,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
They say everything can be replaced,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
In the company of strangers, in the quiet of the railroad station running scared,
And I'm gonna let you pass,
Vomit and jealousy's all that he sells us, he's contented when you're under his thumb,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
With a bottle of oil in his hand,
Old-lady judges watch people in pairs,
You will search, babe, at any cost,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
I can see the turning of the key,
In the foggy web of destiny,
Pull man down on a county hook, my man,
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber,
Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell,
I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
St. Bartholomew's burying ground won't catch your name, but he has the hound,
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
A little piece of cornbread a-laying on a shelf, uh-huh,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
Now, you may call me Terry or you may call me Timmy,
Turn your back, wash your hands,
To get their kicks, get out of it quick,
But I'll know my song well before I start singing,
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze,
Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
I want you,
Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
Since you've been gone,
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed,
The night would see me wide awake,
God don't call it treason,
"Stop all this weeping and swallow your pride,
To have––be on your own,
Stone you when you're trying to make a pass,
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike,
And I don't want to drag you down,
There's not even room enough to be anywhere,
No time to prepare for the victim that's there, no time to suffer or blink,
I just don't see why I should even care,
Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Wedding bells're ringing, the choir is beginning to sing,
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Agárrame, mi vida, soon the desert will be gone,
We never much thought we could get very old,
If you wanna have a picnic, that's up to you,
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
Unto the shoe-less hunter who's gone deaf,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave,
For his age he is wise,
Your lover, who just walked out your door,
They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear,
Watch the river flow,
Go down to the river, babe,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
We eat and we drink, we feel and we think,
And you're knee-deep in dark water with your hands in the air,
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
She would have married me,
My lord and my savior, my companion, my friend,
Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
May you stay forever young,
Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris,
Four by four, no illusion for,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Don't know which is worse – doing your own thing or being cool,
"Not I," said the referee,
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
Never did feel this way before,
I know that fortune is waiting to be kind,
But the time ain't tall,
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move,
You hurt the ones that I love best, then cover up the truth with lies,
Oh, you five- and ten-cent women with nothing in your heads,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
And she'll be coming forth,
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys, did offer him my hand,
The sword swallower walks up to you and he kneels,
All except for Cain and Abel and the Hunchback of Notre Dame,
In each caress, in each tender kiss,
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
From now on this'll be where you're from,
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, gentle and fair,
He said, "That's alright, babe, I love you too,
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors,
They're lying low and they're making hay,
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow,
Watered-down love,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
We got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend, Bello,
Wintertime in New York town,
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
Build me a cabin in Utah,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside,
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Seen his family scattered, people hounded and torn,
My bewildering brain toils in vain,
Lying next to her by the ocean,
Saying, "Ain't I pretty?" and, "Ain't I cute? Look at my skin,
I went into the city, into the town,
I try my best to be like I am,
There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped,
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,
You find God in the church of your choice,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
"I could have married a king's daughter there,
Joey, Joey,
They don't believe in mercy,
"Come along and take a trip,
Now, Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land,
Man's ego's inflated, you know, his laws are outdated,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, there's something that calls for you,
We ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing,
Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Alberta, let your hair hang low,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
In the summertime, oh, in the summertime,
I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past,
Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,
You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
She said, "This can't be the end, we'll meet on another day on the avenue,
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,
It's unbelievable, it's strange but true,
We wanna put his ass in the stir,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind,
The party's over and there's less and less to say,
Precious angel, you believe me when I say,
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
The guilty undertaker sighs, the lonesome organ-grinder cries,
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood, with his memories in a trunk,
In the hills of mystery,
But there's nothing–really nothing to turn off,
And, although that we're single and free,
They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
God knows it's outta sight,
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
I'm going where the chilly winds don't blow,
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were blazing,
You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Through many a dark hour I've been thinking about this,
Forever young, forever young,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Try to be a success,
Oh, everybody that cares is going up the castle-stairs,
When you're standing on the crossroads that you cannot comprehend,
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Stripping away at it all,
Ancient footprints are everywhere,
From the dirty, old mess hall you march to the brick wall,
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair,
She heard the melody rise and fade, the sun was coming up,
Only a hobo, but one more is gone,
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in this song I'm singing,
Through the mad, mystic hammering of the wild, ripping hail,
Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
Spend the night with some sweet señorita,
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,
She turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
Fat man looking in a blade of steel,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Maggie comes fleet-foot,
Broken idols, broken heads,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy,
Come all without, come all within,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Can't hear your name, you can't see your face,
Next to come in was a little, black tick, uh-huh,
His eyes were two slits – make any snake proud,
Who eats, but is not satisfied, who hears, but does not see,
Now, the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom,
You got to serve somebody,
Silhouetted by the sea,
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail,
He wore no rings or fancy things like other gamblers wore,
I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
If you must cling to someone,
Well, the unions are big business, friend,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
Well, there's voices in the night trying to be heard,
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart, or too dumb,
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks,
May be the head of some big TV network,
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Got me a secret membership card,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
He jabbed him once with his bully club,
I must admit, felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Babe, come crawl out your window,
Englishman stranded in a black-heart wind,
You've been with professors, they've all liked your looks,
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
I need a shot of love,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
The sword swallower walks up to you and then he kneels,
Daddy's in the alley looking for the fuze,
I'm singing love's praises with sugarcoated rhyme,
They'll stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you, her worst is better than best,
I was burned out from exhaustion, I was buried in the hail,
Oh, mama, can this really be the end,
I been good,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy,
Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well,
But me, I'm still on the road, heading for another joint,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Love that's pure hopes all things,
Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
I don't compromise and I don't pretend,
I ain't looking to compete with you,
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Father who build the mountain so high,
To know how much I really care,
He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks,
Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Never weak, but always strong,
And your rope is a-sliding 'cause your hands are dripping,
And she turned around to look at him as he was a-walking away,
Oh, my name, it ain't nothing, my age, it means less,
Bent out of shape from society's pliers,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men,
Telling everybody in the neighborhood,
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White,
And, if my thought-dreams could be seen,
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love,
High water rising, the shacks are sliding down,
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
Two by two they step in the dark,
Honey, I will meet you there,
I found my world, found my world in you,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the grass,
And it's all afternoon you remember your hometown,
"Where shall the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
I'm ready to go anywhere,
On this road I'm walking, on this trail I'm turning,
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
They say every distance is not near,
So, now I'm going on back again, maybe tomorrow or maybe next year,
Mother, you know, must hear the news,
I just can't beg you anymore,
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
"No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
The confusion I'm feeling ain't no tongue can tell,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold,
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit,
To keep up his hate,
Men in Atlanta trying to pass for white,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson in his grave,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat,
I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back,
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Looked behind the clothes, behind the chair,
They got him outnumbered 'bout a million to one,
Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
Don't criticize what you can't understand,
Take what you have gathered from coincidence,
With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold,
I'm pledging my time to you,
Look, Mrs. Henry, there's only so much I can do,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
And where do you look for this hope that you're seeking,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol,
I like the way that you move your hips,
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
That old ship was sinking down in the water,
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
The country music station plays soft,
That two healers cannot heal him,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face,
But you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
Both were so glad to watch me destroy what I had,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Or have done something wrong,
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
There's a retired businessman named Red,
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital,
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned,
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
Well, the devil's shining light, it can be most blinding,
Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
Among the dead and dying, her darling love she found,
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
For the mistreated, mate-less mother, the mis-titled prostitute,
For the days of old when we dug up the gold, in the days of '49,
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest, dark forest,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
It's making you mad, it's making you mean,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a pail of milk,
I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
Puts the pied-pipers in prison and fattens the slaves,
How many a year has passed and gone,
I never can go because, you know,
I was born here and I'll die here against my will,
And to come every time you call,
I was looking every place for them god-darned Reds,
A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking on by the arcade,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your jaw,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
Where do you look for this candle that's glowing,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
And didn't even talk to the people at the table,
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind,
"Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
The wicked know no peace and you just can't fake it,
While money doesn't talk, it swears,
Oh, it's fare-thee-well to the deep, hollow dungeon,
You know, capitalism is above the law,
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
But don't tell me about it, I don't wanna hear it,
There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
God don't make promises that He don't keep,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Now, Ira's folks were hungry and their farms were crops of weeds,
I was raised in the country, I been working in the town,
And I'm back in the rain,
They say every man must fall,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door,
We take great delight in our own company,
Don't even feel like crossing the street and my car ain't acting right,
Yes, I walked all night long listening to them church bells tone,
Well, there ain't no going back,
I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
There's always another stranger sneaking glances,
In the little church a-this side of town,
How could they ever have persuaded you,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive as you or me,
Well, you know––even before I learned her name,
"Well, I spied me a girl and, before she could leave,
Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore,
Oh, you been with the professors, they've all liked your looks,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick,
And I answer them most mysteriously,
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel,
Spanish is the loving tongue,
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, in the beginning,
Whoa! and––well, I can do just like the rest, you know, I like my sugar sweet,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
People'd call, say, "Beware, doll,
Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Way up in the border country far from the towns,
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid,
And the sooner you come up with them,
Everything's a-hers or his,
And your bell's banging loudly but you can't hear its beat,
Then she went into the vessel to convey herself away,
Ever since I been a child,
At the close of the day,
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
Precious father, loving mother,
I love you, pretty baby,
You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
Shedding off one more layer of skin,
Heart of mine, go back home,
Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,
Gypsy Davy with a blowtorch, he burns out their camps,
They say that your ore ain't worth digging,
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve,
Sara, oh, Sara, glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
I went down where the vultures feed,
Rock me, pretty baby, rock me all at once,
Summer days and the summer nights are gone,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived here from the coast,
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
Boys in the street beginning to play,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
Without a dream in my heart,
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold,
You got something I want plenty of,
Singing about conspiracy, wanting me to be afraid,
Well, aching, tumbled, with all laid down,
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen,
Well, come all without, come all within,
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
They're doing the double shuffle, they're throwing sand on the floor,
He stood so straight and tall in his uniform and all,
Now, lamp-gates and [incomprehensible], I can recite 'em all,
Into her dark chamber she will greet you,
I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes,
Seeing the metal brace that helped him stand,
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes,
But people don't live or die, people just float,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
Broken treaties, broken vows,
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
And even you, yesterday, you had to ask me where it was at,
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign,
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
Well, the time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind,
Now, to her death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest,
All the furniture, it say "Made in Brazil",
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band,
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Don't walk on your tip-toes,
He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
When someone is pulling the wool over me,
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
Drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep,
For Halloween buy her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum,
Hang around the ink-well,
The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
Try hard, get barred,
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
I threw it all away,
So many roads, so much at stake,
Dad's in a alley looking hard for the fuze,
So, all you rambling gamblers, wherever you might be,
Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
I don't wanna meet your kin,
Watching the river flow,
They're all drinking and thinking that they got it made,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven unwrapped their bedroll,
Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
May you always a-be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
High water rising, six inches 'bove my head,
With my head bowed down to my shoes,
I'm on the rolling river in a jerking boat,
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
A world war can be won you want me to believe,
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud's,
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres,
They must bust in early May,
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Way out in the distance I know you're with some other man,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin,
Made before the foundation of the world,
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
I'll go see them come down my way,
Her heart will be broken when I am gone,
And my wig-hat was falling in my face,
"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small,
Bouncing around a pinball machine,
The joint is jumping,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
And comes to a permanent stop,
That won't laugh at your looks, your voice, or your face,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away,
The man there said he loved my sound,
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
To look up in the world from a hole in the ground,
I can't speak the sounds to show no pain,
I'm a good old boy, but I've been sniffing too many eggs,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth,
In love and with kindness,
And I don't really care, ooh, what happens next,
It was then that I got up to leave, but she said, "Don't forget,
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
God knows there's a river,
High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
There's smoke on the water, it's a-been there since June,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
Ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it's funny,
I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
But I did it because he lied, because he took you for a ride,
"If you, my love, must think that way,
Aim well, my little one,
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
"Get down, get down, love Henry," she cried,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a gypsy queen,
Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
Don't steal, don't lift,
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents,
They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting the passports brown,
Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Thank You, Lord,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
Now, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers' club,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
My love winks, she doesn't bother,
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
As the light burst through a beat-up shade, where he was waking up,
Who despise their jobs, their destinies,
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song,
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Neighborhood bully, been driven out of every land,
He bought the American dream, but it put him in debt,
That the world ain't got you beat, it ain't got you licked,
Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
We met at the station where the mission bells ring,
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve,
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Standing by God's river, my soul's beginning to shake,
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold,
I'd only have to stay,
Next to come in was the Juney bug,
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
I shall be released,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
With a killer's pride, security,
Oh, yes, I'm pressing on,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
"And we have no desire to take your advance,
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
Laying low,
Lord, listen to that cold whistle blow,
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel,
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats,
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on,
Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Get born, keep warm,
Don't know how it all got started, don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Saying, "Gold will never free your father,
She looked at him, he felt a spark tingle to her bones,
Come, mothers and fathers throughout the land,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war,
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
It's too bad he had to go,
'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Yes, and only if she was lying by me,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
Pretty flowers are made for blooming, pretty stars are made to shine,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
She never does me wrong,
But, deep inside my heart,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Wiggle to the front, wiggle to the rear,
He got that clear crystal fountain,
Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Never needed to call you my whore,
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
They're taking a streetcar named "Desire",
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head,
Young man looking in the shadows that pass,
Well, I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Now, if someone offers me a joke,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag,
They say, "Lose your inhibition, follow your own ambition",
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
Someone who don't pick herself up to make every man her friend,
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is,
You never understood that it ain't no good,
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
You always responded when I needed your help,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
It could even be like a myth,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
When the night comes falling,
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Asking the cops wherever I go,
If fire them we're forced to, then fire them we must,
"I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light,
And placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain,
So, go on, boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime,
Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies,
Our words was told, our songs was sung,
Says he's got a bad cough,
My own heart's in the [incomprehensible],
Madams light the candles,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
She told me, though, that one day we would meet up again,
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
And, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
You know, you can make a name for yourself,
For her to arrive,
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,
Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
There's none but Jack the sailor would have this heart of mine,
All I remember is waking up on the shore,
And you yell to yourself and you throw down your hat,
Well, he gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards,
And they wouldn't hurt a fly – to hurt one, they would weep,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
"I was feeling kinda lonesome and blue,
I'd get on the stage and sing and play,
She had sweethearts plenty and men of high degree,
And the sun will respect every face on the deck,
Now, I don't care just a-what you do,
And your heart feels sick like fish when they're frying,
It was you who came right through,
And joined the John Birch Society,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to hide,
And she aches just like a woman,
What drives a-me to you is what drives me insane,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
May be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-size bed,
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright,
They're drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes,
And some people thinking that the end is close by,
Early one morning the sun was shining, I was a-laying in bed,
I bargained for salvation, they gave me a lethal dose,
Thrown in like bandits and cast off like criminals,
Stone you when you're walking on the path,
Just then the order came to charge,
Screaming, she moans that I've just been made,
Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
And I drove down Forty-second Street,
And I know what you're thinking of,
Two by two to their lovers they flew,
To hide 'neath a hood,
I'm going out of my mind,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Beat that horse and saddle up the drum,
That one doctor cannot save him,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your seat,
Well, I walked all night long hearing them church bells tone,
It's people's games you got to dodge,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that,
But you try with your whole soul,
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums,
Trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended,
As the night comes in falling, the dogs'll lose their bark,
Hmm, I can make it through,
So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
But evidently she don't,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
Me if I don't get out the door in two seconds flat,
Poverty and shame was theirs,
All I really wanna do,
Jesus said, "Be ready for you know not the hour which I come",
Using every angle under the sun,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved,
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
Yeah, from the stage they'll be trying to get water outta rocks,
Listen to that cold whistle blow,
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm flailing,
Had nothing to do with picnic,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
If you can't quit your sinning,
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
Nothing too very scientific,
Now, I wish to my soul that I had seven years, uh-huh,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze,
Señor, Señor, you know, their hearts're as hard as leather,
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
Tell her not to worry,
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
I see the turning of the page, curtain rising on a new age,
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true,
There's guns across the river 'bout to pound you,
And you know I could never be your own,
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame,
Well, you're on your own – you always were – in a land of wolves and thieves,
Come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Five by five, as I stay on the line,
I wish I'd have been a doctor,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle, says, "Open up another deck",
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up a-to be true,
Who among them could ever think he could destroy you,
Never did get up and walk the floor,
And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
Give you my money, honey,
And think they're fooling you,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
Oh, mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines,
Going home,
Beating for the dead that rise,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Near broken chains, mountain laurel, and rolling rocks,
Leaving nobody to carry him home,
He said that he only deals in cash, would sell tickets to a plane crash,
Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
No, it ain't in the rumors people're telling you,
I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun,
Day you quit me, baby,
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
And you can hitchhike on the highway,
Into my own parade,
Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
You're right from your side, I'm right from mine,
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
Every day is the same thing, out the door,
You can either go to the church of your choice,
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
If today was not a crooked highway,
I can finish this alone, honey,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
Well, don't know which one is worse – doing your own thing or just being cool,
John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore,
Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
But, if I could, I'd bring you to the mountain-top, girl,
We live in a political world,
Inside the museums infinity's going up on trial,
"It's too bright a light," he said, "for anybody's eyes,
Why she did go,
Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in,
A little piece of cornbread laying on the shelf, uh-huh,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Like you never did before,
Long distance operator, place this call, it's not for fun,
When I saw that my partner, he was just being friendly,
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Pistol-shots ring out in the barroom night,
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn,
There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
You may be somebody's mistress, may be somebody's heir,
Ah, get sick, get well,
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
I don't care if you feel like me,
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
Mama come in and picked up a book and papa asked her what it was,
Well, come over here, pony, I wanna climb up one time on you,
Jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
Every step of the way we walk the line,
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea,
The moon gives light and shines by night,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag,
Idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth––teeth,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
Snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
"What should the wedding supper be?" Uh-huh,
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Seen you in the sunshine, I seen you in the dark,
I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Everybody wants you to be like them,
Oh, the hours that I've spent inside the Colosseum,
May God bless and keep you always, may your wishes all come true,
Ain't nothing left here, partner,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Far away where the soft winds blow,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
May you grow up to be righteous, may you grow up to be true,
Yes, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
But you're doing it again,
Everybody from right now to over there and back,
Looks up at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief,
Now he's buried in the rocks,
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Well, the time will tell who has fell, who's been left behind,
I said, "Oh, come on, now,
Who've lost all ray of hope,
Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve,
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
To gather flowers constantly,
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race,
There's a way to get there and I'll figure it out somehow,
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
She answered to him with a loving smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Farewell to the boardwalk that takes you to the screen,
I been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips,
Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
You say you love me and you're thinking of me, but you know you could be wrong,
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
She wears an Egyptian ring and it sparkles just before she speaks,
Someone who likes simple things, is not afraid to bend,
Walking through the leaves falling from the trees,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, rattle and shake,
Well, the sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
A soldier sits beneath the fan, doing business a-with a tiny man, who sells him a ring,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
Yes, but, if you want me to,
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama, hey,
She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
I wish tonight were here,
Got behind him on his horse and they rode off together,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
Gonna get low-down, gonna fly high,
Neighborhood bully, he just lives to survive,
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
His old eyes deepened in his head,
If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise,
She's opened up a happy home,
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations,
Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming, women a-yelling,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
And you feel the reins from your pony are slipping,
Next to come in was a big, black snake,
The angels play on their horns all day,
The line, it is drawn and the curse, it is cast,
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl with the rose in her hair,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
They got mystery written all over their forehead,
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Too noble to neglect,
Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
Saying, "Fist-fighting is here to stay,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying,
You can mislead a man, take hold of his heart with your eyes,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
But I'm saved,
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame,
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low,
I am not pleading or saying "I can't forget you",
"Without my uncle Rat's consent,
God knows when,
Just don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Well, sweet, pretty things, they're in bed now of course,
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Every nerve is analyzed,
No, I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace,
Take a deep breath, feel like you're choking,
Yes, the last thing you said before you hit the street,
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame,
And, when the fight was over and Old Glory raised,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
There's a lone soldier on the hill, watching 'fore them raindrops pour,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Get behind me on my horse and we'll ride off together,
I once held her in my arms,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
If another war comes, it's them we must fight,
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
Ten thousand miles away from home,
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers in case I might see you,
Who suddenly walks up to you when he hears you speak,
For the wise men and the fools,
Strangers all give me the news,
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Has taken all his blankets from the floor,
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
And point away from the past,
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit,
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on,
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
She smiled and she went right down, she looked up and all around,
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Frankie went down to Twelfth Street, look up through the window high,
The roving gambler was a-very bored,
No more affection that's misplaced, girl,
Saying, "I don't know when I'll be coming back again,
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you,
You keep listening to something long enough, you're just bound to believe that it's true,
Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ,
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
In the night the grounds was groaning,
And to come each time you call,
I seen your lover man coming, coming 'cross the barren field,
I can handle whatever I stumble upon,
Made of silver or of golden,
Don't let her know that you love her,
I'm watching the roads, I'm studying the dust,
Then, when a letter finally came, saying, go down and meet the train,
They can exalt you up or bring you down bankrupt,
And you're flat on your belly with your hands tied behind,
She broke her leg and needed shooting,
Doesn't have to say she's faithful,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
My limbs are shaking,
As we went a-walking down by the seaside,
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide,
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone,
Don't matter what you did,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
People talk over situations,
Thinking about the government,
Who uses all his power to do evil, but in the end is always left so alone,
And your magazine-husband, who one day just had to go,
And on the highway of regret,
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
Sleeping in the saddle, sleeping in a king-size bed,
I ran right through the front door like a hobo-sailor does,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
When I peeked out from a manhole cover,
And the poet and the painter, far behind his rightful time,
Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you,
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
In the home of the brave, Jefferson turning over in his grave,
I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Wiggle till it opens, wiggle till it shuts,
If I––I didn't have to guess,
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Starting look on the sidewalk,
Far away and over the wall,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Groundhog running by the country stream,
They're all drinking, thinking they got it made,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
I told you, baby, right to your head,
You have given me eyes to see,
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
What drives me to you is what drives me insane,
To be one your own,
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
Sara, oh, Sara, wherever we travel we're never apart,
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
You say you're sorry for telling me stories you know I believe are true,
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,
Get back, write Braille,
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo,
Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Three by three they danced on the sea,
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed,
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century,
Here's to Cisco, and Sonny, and Leadbelly too,
People carry roses,
Don't say 'murder', don't say 'kill',
Oxford Town, Oxford Town,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
She wears an Egyptian ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
Shadows even the silver spoon,
Seven days,
I want my arms around you,
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances,
The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
A complete unknown,
Next to come in was the old, gray cat, uh-huh,
"God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
Standing by God's river, my soul beginning to shake,
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore,
"Or else you'll surely hang," says he, "And after that, Jim Jones,
All of these awful things that I have heard,
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
And it's only that I'm asking,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
But he can't be blamed,
Want you so bad,
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
That six diggers cannot bury him,
Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
Come gather round, people, wherever you roam,
Well, I asked for something to eat – I'm hungry as a hog,
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man,
I'll go to some bar-room and drink with my friends,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
But I'm pledging my time to you,
There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend,
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty,
The lamp-post stands with folded arms,
To protect his white skin,
Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
No younger than twelve, no older than seventeen,
He laid his head on a pillow of down,
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple,
They say that vanity got the best of him,
It's not aimed at anyone,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
What good am I if I know and don't do,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Nearly drove me crazy with the wagging of his jaw,
Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
What good am I if I'm like all the rest,
If you're traveling in the north country fair,
I came to a high place of darkness and light,
Leaving the towns I love the best,
He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Desperate men, desperate women divided,
Sara, Sara, sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
I can hear them tribes moaning, hear that undertaker's bell,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
The only son of God Almighty,
I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
A-Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
But it would not be new,
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart,
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
I heard her say over my shoulder, "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
But I will be back, I will survive,
Watch a-waterfalls of pity roar,
'Tell your ma, tell your pa,
And, though I can't sleep at night for trying,
So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
Don't let her hear,
One by one until there were none,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
So glad,
May be rich or poor, may be blind or lame,
Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Outside of two men on the train tracks, there nobody in sight,
A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
When both of us, baby, were going though some kind of a test,
All the gold and silver being stolen away,
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
Now there's spiritual warfare, flesh and blood breaking down,
I courted her proudly, but now she is gone,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
Stone you when you're standing at the bar,
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail,
When a trembling, distant voice, unclear,
There'll be a time, I hear tell,
I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
The haunted, frightened trees,
I had so much left to do,
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
I yelled for Captain Arab, I'll have you understand,
And it's keep down your head and stay in your number,
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
Hold me, baby, be near,
Light yourself a candle,
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey,
I don't sense affection – no, no gratitude or love,
Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
Flung down by corpse evangelists,
Bird, fly high by the light of the moon,
Hanging 'round the theaters,
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're quite lame,
Waiting for the trains,
And sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds,
Two by two, to another rendezvous,
I don't care how many letters they sent, morning came and morning went,
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
Insanity is smashing up against my soul,
Got a little girl, she stays upstairs,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
But it ain't him to blame,
I said, "Nothing, baby, and that's for sure." She leaned down into my face,
You're gonna have to serve somebody,
Love that's pure no accident,
Next to come in was a broken-back flea, uh-huh,
Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
See you fly or watch you die,
When the storm clouds gather 'round you and heavy rains descend,
Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
Nothing was delivered,
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space,
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
I'll look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, or Ashtabula,
The night passed away so quickly,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
You should not treat me like a stranger,
They was in the air, they was on the ground,
There's always one more notch in four more aces,
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
Men a-flying, fists a-flying, paper flying,
Next to come in was a broken, black flea, uh-huh,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
I was thinking 'bout the things that Rosie said,
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
"Well, I got up and I walked around,
Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Dream about you, baby,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
I hate myself for loving you and the weakness that it showed,
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word,
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling bustles,
Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
It didn't seem like much was happening, so I turned it off and went to grab another beer,
That fired the gun,
The sun is beginning to shine on me,
Her folks, they said our lives together sure was gonna be rough,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
As I travel down life's pathway,
Don't let me drift too far,
There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Frankie went to the scaffold calm as a girl could be,
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down,
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St. John,
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
That run around gallant, make all rules for the ones that got talent,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
You can hear them tires squeal,
Time is piling up, we struggle and we scrape,
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
All day long I hear him crying out so loud,
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,
"They've all moved a way," said the voice of a stranger,
Now, you take your file and you bend my head,
And their old, rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,
Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
You angel, you, you're as fine as anything's fine,
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale, everything looking blue,
Well, I'm pressing on,
Whoa, come all without, come all within,
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
It's many a guard that stands around smiling,
I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
I went down to scrub and rub,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
See the craters and the canyons and where the waterfalls run,
It all seemed so well-timed,
I won't have my nature way,
The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
"Pull off, pull off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Teachers teach that knowledge waits,
Babe, please crawl out your window,
People going down to the ground,
Under the microscope,
The king of the Philistines, his soldiers to save,
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
I run right home and I went to bed,
Well, I need a woman to take my own,
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
But ye shall be a-changed,
A pretty, dancing girl was there and she began to shout,
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook, uh-huh,
You know I was straight with you, you know I never tried to change you in any way,
You crawl into the room like a camel and you frown,
He's not selling any alibis,
Well, the old men 'round here, sometimes they get on bad terms with the younger men,
I ain't looking to make you cry,
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
Money doesn't talk, it swears,
The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Your mama, she's hiding inside the icebox,
The air is getting hotter,
You were drawing water for your husband, you were suffering under the law,
Want you,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Just like a rolling stone,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
She looked at me, begin to smile,
"Well, I ain't gonna tell you no story, I ain't gonna tell you no lie,
Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
May be living in another country under another name,
It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I wish I could write you a melody so plain,
Keep a clean nose,
Who'd turn you in for a tenth of a penny,
Well, get sick, get well,
Hazel, you called and I came,
At Delilah, who's sitting worthlessly alone,
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number,
Take you where the grass grows green, you never will want for money,
Yeah, there ain't no going back,
I just say no thanks,
As I was out walking on the corner one day,
Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
And your good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle in your boots and shoes,
Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
Precious memories, how they linger,
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air,
Eight by eight they got to the gate,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
They'll stone you when you're driving in your brain,
Oh, tell my baby sister not to do what I have done,
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
That you're tired of yourself and all your creations,
You'll be doing society a favor,
But you, you changed my life, came along in a time of strife,
There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
Oxford Town around the bend,
First degree and second degree,
So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train,
Neighborhood bully, standing on a hill,
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail, real dirty face and a curly tail,
Like in the middle of Life magazine,
You don't want a love that's pure,
Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
And ride a horse along the trail,
Into your eyes, where the moonlight swims,
And, when I'm called up yonder and it's my time to go,
God knows it's a struggle,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd get that off his head,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
"Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
Oh, get born, keep warm,
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,
In the darkness of my night,
Like as not, it's better so,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
They say that every man must fall,
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar,
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
But the bottles are done,
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind,
Beyond here lies nothing,
I noticed at the ceremony that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
Trick on in, flower that <i>smoll</i>,
Grandpa died last week,
But I don't sense affection, no gratitude or love,
Seem like I been down this way before,
Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
To be alone with you,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Always was a sucker for the right cross,
Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
She never stumbles, she got no place to fall,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate,
Praise be to Nero's Neptune, the Titanic sails at dawn,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
Living in the land of Nod,
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Stripes on your shoulder, stripes on your back and on your hand,
And your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
Well, the fog's so thick you can't spy the land,
This couple, they got married, so well they did agree,
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves,
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance,
Down on the surface with a [incomprehensible],
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
They started up Iwo Jima hill two hundred and fifty men,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
Later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave,
One by one they followed the sun,
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
All across the telegraph his name, it did resound,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming, see the ghost of slavery ships,
Don't wanna be a bum,
Will be rolling long after the bubble-gum craze,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
I said a quick prayer just to feel satisfied,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
You keep me worried and bothered all of the time,
As human gods aim for their mark,
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
And he was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on his shoes,
One more night the stars are in sight,
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Three by three, it don't set on me,
Call girls in the doorway, all giving me the eye,
Neither one gonna turn and run,
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb,
Up on the white veranda, she wears a necktie and a Panama hat,
Social clubs in drag disguise,
Precious angel under the sun,
And you start walking backwards though you know that it's wrong,
But the thing that scared me most, when my enemy came close,
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
And, though they could not produce the gun,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet,
Now, my mama always said, "Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
Many a gamble has been lost and won,
May be a construction worker working on a home,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Says he's got a bad bill,
Father of day, father of night,
You were striped, you were plain,
But I've been hanging on,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Took the wife and kids down to the pier,
We'll go someplace unknown,
The crystal ball upon the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
I've never forgotten her eyes,
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning,
Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
If you go when the snowflakes fall,
The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
People see me all the time, I guess they just can't remember how to act,
Temptation's page a-flies out the door,
You may own guns and you may even own tanks,
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere,
Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
Honey baby, don't leave me now,
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Now, the Spanish-American War had its day,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And come every time you call,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones,
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together,
Kick my legs to crash it off,
A question in your nerves is lit,
You were telling him about Buddha, you were telling him 'bout Muhammad in one breath,
"Lie there, lie there, love Henry," she cried,
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
But you're gonna have to serve somebody,
Shake the dust off of your feet, don't look back,
I met a young girl – she gave me a rainbow,
She wears an Egyptian red ring, it sparkles before she speaks,
He said the name, Bojangles, and he danced a lick all across the cell,
There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
The rebels they shot and shelled,
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns,
Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
Look out across the fields, see me returning,
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky,
I got shoved down, got pushed around,
Now, I'm starting to drain, my stool's gonna squeak,
Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Only one thing I did wrong,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky grew dark,
Till the keys of the guards clicked the tune of the morning,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Get jailed, jump bail,
Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,
Someone to close his heart,
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Watch waterfalls of pity roar,
With that half-wit comedian on it,
Fare thee well but for a while,
Just like I did before,
Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer,
I went down to the lobby to make a small call out,
Freedom, just around the corner for you,
Everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he'd fought to save,
You gotta look some other place,
Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
And play games with each other in their sand-box world,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
You might be [incomprehensible] on the start,
So you can read out your hymn-book,
Tell me,
She never stumbles, she's got no place to fall,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
I don't want nothing from anyone, ain't that much to take,
Mercury, gravity,
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack,
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends,
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail,
Got a little girl, who's little and low,
Don't need a shot of codeine to help me to repent,
He got that soft, silky skin,
Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
As his youth now unfolds,
There ought to be a law against you coming around,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's mama moaned,
If'n you don't know by now,
And I'm just like that bird,
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
Frankie was a good girl, everybody know,
Father of cold and father of heat,
They said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you,
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail,
And gathering storms may arise,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out,
Over the hills and far away,
Odds and ends, odds and ends,
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
Not the end, not the end,
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich,
And your silver cross and your voice like chimes,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it,
Don't know how it all got started, I don't know what they're doing with their lives,
Or down any movie star's blouse,
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace,
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Short pants, romance, learn to dance,
But I'm pressing on,
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
Without a love of my own,
Pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul, from me to you,
I had a job in the Great North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
I had a woman down in Alabama,
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at,
Serve somebody,
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see,
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
Going, going, gone,
Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoe,
And the hypnotic, splattered mist was slowly lifting,
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true,
And I'll tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it,
Wants eleven dollar bills,
Now there's a wall between us, something there's been lost,
But he never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
Don't know what I could say about Claudette wouldn't come back to haunt me,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping,
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
Where I will always be renewed,
Well, I gave you all my money,
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
Yet every distance is not near,
I never could guess your weight, baby,
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
On the stone that remains,
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
He hears the ticking of the clocks, walks alone through the city blocks,
In the smoke of the twilight, on a milk-white steed,
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay,
I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
I'd go crawling down the avenue,
Rock me for a little while, rock me for a couple of months,
"Young maiden, I wish not to banter, 'tis true I come here in disguise,
Exchanging all precious gifts and things,
To be out on your own,
That must be what it's all about,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singing,
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Look out, kid,
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
He hands––out in your face for kicks,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
The wind blowing the snow around,
Princess up on the steeple and all them pretty people,
A hand set the spark,
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Come, a-writers and critics who prophesize with your pen,
Till both of us fell by the way,
Some things are too terrible to be true,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
He saw an animal up on a hill chewing up so much grass until he was filled,
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
I'm telling myself I found true happiness,
Pull man down in pulley hook, let 'em take me or take a look,
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge,
And pretend that we never have touched,
Well, I got a woman five feet short,
Stick with me, baby, stick with me anyhow,
If that was you in the dream that was screaming,
China doll, alcohol,
And the point is slick,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
She's looking into my eyes, she's a-holding my hand,
Don't wanna be with nobody tonight,
There's a woman by the river with some fine, young, handsome man,
From Broadway to the Milky Way,
Socialism, hypnotism,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
Well, my captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
I went back home, put on my tie,
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
And I want you to be that woman, yes, I do,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things sometimes are,
That her father was going to hang,
But Louise, she's alright, she's just near,
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting,
Well, I got here following the Southern Star,
And you want someone that you don't have to speak to,
Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Footprints running 'cross a silver sand,
Till one day my brother failed to come home,
Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
Oh, honey baby, don't leave me now,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
I ain't too good at conversation, girl,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
And it's ride, a-Willie, ride,
It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
The dividing line ran through the center of town,
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Someone to gather flowers constantly,
And it's ride, Willie, ride,
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake,
Now, if you see Saint Annie, please tell her "Thanks a lot",
Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying to make out what it was,
That carry 'round a fire-hose,
I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
I bargained for salvation and she give me a lethal dose,
Everybody, get ready to lift up your glasses and sing,
Well, God is in his heaven and we all want what's his,
A man named Martin Luther King,
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
Starry-eyed and laughing, as I recall, when we were caught,
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night,
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
Oh, come all without, come all within,
Stone you when you're set down in your grave,
To show me the kinda love that don't have to be condemned,
I bless the day I found you,
And the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way,
Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
And the whole world's watching with the "window-peek" stare,
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride, uh-huh,
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue,
And you fear they might catch you sleeping,
Staying far behind without you,
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
Don't need a shot of heroin to kill my disease,
Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
I'm going down the river,
Praise you, dear lady, from going insane,
After a while we took in the clothes, nobody said very much,
With silver bracelets on her wrists, flowers in her hair,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses,
To shine in through,
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town, the old one is long gone,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
Heart of mine,
With the storms raging 'round us and the winds a-blowing gales,
Took her by the hand and my heart was thumping,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances,
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field,
Then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me,
I'm painting the town, swinging my partner around,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
She got a letter once in a while, her face broke into a smile,
Heading out for the old East Coast, radio blasting the news straight on through,
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzing around your eyes,
Ring them bells, ye heathen, from the city that dreams,
God knows you ain't pretty,
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
In the lonely night,
And picking up Angel, who just arrived from the coast,
Maybe someday, when you're by yourself, alone,
Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads,
So, never leave me lonely,
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
In death you face life with a child and a wife who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls,
Then Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein,
And every cause that ever I fought,
Oh, my heart is so sad 'cause I want you so bad,
I got a woman, she's so mean,
And I got those worried blues,
It's really something,
Well, I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray,
Don't let her know,
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
The First World War, boys, it came and it went,
As the echo of the wedding bells, before the blowing rain,
A foreign sound to your ear,
Mama's in the factory. she ain't got no shoes,
On this new morning, new morning,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands at the break of day,
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
I've learned to hate the Russians all through my whole life,
Rubin Carter was falsely tried,
The path you've endured has been rough,
Somewhere down the road some day,
You feel to moan, but, unlike before,
We've killed each one,
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse,
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud,
You have given everything to me,
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
Blue river running slow and lazy,
You married young just like your ma,
Six months on the chain gang,
No, nothing was delivered,
I'm just gonna let you pass,
But, all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
Silvio, I gotta go,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
To find out if she's talked,
Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
She goes away for a minute and I slide out outta my chair,
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants,
I know the reason that you talk behind my back,
And the wood's easy finding but you're lazy to fetch it,
Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
But it ain't me, babe,
––Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied,
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more,
I don't care about economy, I don't care about astronomy,
You may be somebody's landlord, you may even own banks,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
It blows their minds a-most a-bitterly,
As the present now will later be past,
And, when it finally––the bottom fell out, I became withdrawn,
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
For they opened fire and somehow drove that pirate ship away,
Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers's blood,
People are crazy, times are strange,
How did I meet you?––I don't know,
You belong to someone else and I do too,
No direction home,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
You might be rich or poor, may be a parasite too,
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace,
I'm stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow,
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition,
It always means so much,
I just don't know what to do,
No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
And, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
And, if this war comes and death's all around,
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll,
Mr. Frog went a-hopping up over the brook,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
Big Joe Turner looking east and west from the dark room of his mind,
At pettiness, which plays so rough,
You that build the death planes, you that build all the bombs,
Tombstone bay dog can't get it done,
Thin man looking at his last meal,
And you want someone to put out your ambition,
Um, when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb,
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all came down to do tricks for you,
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff,
Yeah, and––well, I'm not gonna tell you why that is,
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife,
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
Kill that beast and feed that swine,
Four by four they danced on the shore,
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
Mama, take this badge off of me,
You may be an ambassador to England or France,
Well, I'm groaning in the hallway, pretty soon I'll be mad,
When the judge saw Reilly's daughter,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy,
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat,
She'll surely turn to white,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
A man with a badge skips by,
My senses have been stripped,
For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for 'bout four or five months,
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady,
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind,
Well, the children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
"There's no time for mischief there," they say. "Remember that," says they,
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns,
There's an Iron Cross still hanging down from around her neck,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
And it ain't on Macy's window-sill,
"There must be some way outta here," said the joker to the thief,
You broke a heart that loved you,
Most of the time I'm halfways content,
She is good to me and there's nothing she doesn't see,
And your flesh like silk and your face like glass,
She said, "Your debutante knows what you need,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Goodness hides behind its gates,
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
It's alright,
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
I had to leave there in a hurry,
Stone you just like they said they would,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
So I got those worries blues,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Go get me my pistol, babe,
And you know that it's something special you're needing,
I like the smile in your fingertips,
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within,
They say every man need protection,
I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low,
Thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Don't you tell Henry,
He had a-one too many lovers and none of 'em were too refined – all except for you,
Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Here's the story of the "Hurricane",
Oh, the years passed again and the giving was good,
Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
Some warn victory, some downfall,
Now, the senator came down here showing everyone his gun,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
They let him out in '71, he'd lost a little weight,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
They say every man must need protection,
Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Mama in a factory ,she ain't got no shoes,
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
Father of black, father of white,
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
Though her voice, it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,
Last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
Come and listen for a moment, lads, and hear me tell my tale,
Now, the moon is almost hidden, the stars, they're just pretending to hide,
He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible] and Wilhelm Reich,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force,
Through this open world I'm bound to ramble,
That long, black cloud is coming down,
And no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding,
If none but Jack the sailor would ever suit your mind,
Everybody moving – if they ain't already there,
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door,
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
See her in that very tight skirt,
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn,
Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows,
Hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
I got the worried blues,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Strike another match, go start anew,
I see people who're supposed to know better standing around like furniture,
I've been saved – well, alright,
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab,
And, on their promises of paradise,
"No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love,
It's pride, and prejudice, and superstition, indeed,
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless, seeking trail,
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast,
The cavalries charged, the Indians fell,
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies,
Took Ms. Mousey on his knee,
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
You could look at it and weep,
Where the angels stand high on the poles,
"Don't you remember, ma, when I went off to war,
It's unbelievable, it's fancy-free,
Well, he's surrounded by pacifists who all want peace,
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder,
A self-ordained professor's tongue,
I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Big-time negotiators, false healers, and woman-haters,
Freight train was the one taught me how to cry,
Mama's in a factory, she ain't got no shoes,
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless,
Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall,
You can stick your head in the sand,
Went back home to the yard,
I got a wife and five little children,
'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Broken bottles, broken plates,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
And the wind punched hard to make the wall-siding sing,
But now we got weapons of chemical dust,
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true,
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose,
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
With their humorless smile so easy to see through,
From their fates try to resign,
But you were gambling for support,
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
Drinking, thinking that they got it made,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
Idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
By and by I'm breathing a lover's sigh,
I fell down to my bended knees,
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hanging dry,
There were six thousand people trying to kill each other,
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
She said, "Don't you tell Henry,
Who will promise never to part,
Well, I'm scuffling and I'm shuffling and I'm walking on briars,
Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood,
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning,
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough,
My woman needs it every day,
It's people's games that you got to dodge,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
My voice is really warm, it's just that it ain't got no form,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
And some of us'll end up to be lawyers and things,
They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
And I would send a message to find out if she's talked,
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
You want watered-down love,
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Well, I'm leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift,
He's the property of Jesus,
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand,
We set out that night for the cold in the north,
He said, "I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
Whose heaven is like Ironside's, whose tears are like rain,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i> no solution for trouble,
Broken buckles, broken laws,
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game,
The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Trouble,
Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
Most of the time it's well understood,
You came, you saw, just like the law,
Tell me, tell me, I've got to know,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure,
Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
God knows everything,
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike,
With what your fate is going to be,
It's unbelievable like a lead balloon,
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale,
Equality, liberty,
They say that you've been seen with some other man,
It felt out of place, my foot in his face,
As some warn victory, some downfall,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Jokerman, dance to the nightingale tune,
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
I blowed inside out and upside down,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Wiggle till it whispers, wiggle till it hums,
She sticks my boots in the washing machine,
Well, your friends come by for you, I don't know what to say,
Well, the wind keeps blowing me up and down the street,
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Man's ego's inflated, his laws are outdated,
Baby, thank you for my tea,
It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch,
And if I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots, tailgates and substitutes,
You've never learned to read or write, there's no books upon your shelf,
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously,
And I––I walk out on my own,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
Something about you that I can't shake,
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade,
'Twas in the summer one early fall,
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
May you build a ladder to the stars, climb on every rung,
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
You suddenly find you've got nothing to fear,
If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
Front door shut, back door too,
House on fire, debts unpaid,
Everybody wants to be my friend, but nobody wants to get higher,
Simplify you, classify you,
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice,
If he needs a third eye, he just grows it,
Me and Magdalena on the run,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
And later on, as the crowd thinned out, I's about to do the same,
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need,
And it ain't in the cream-puff hairdo or cotton-candy clothes,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
How to enter into the gates of paradise, no,
"The calls of my master compelled me from home,
The war soon being over, they hunted all around,
Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
You lose yourself, you reappear,
I see a house in the country being a-torn apart from within,
Samantha Brown lived in my house for about four or five months,
Winter would have no spring,
I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou,
She once was a true love of mine,
I have no one to meet,
I've shined your shoes, I've moved your mountains and marked your cards,
Now, the jury found me guilty, then says the judge, says he,
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie,
You've only murdered my father, raped his wife,
I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs,
I spied a fair maid at her labour, which caused me to stay for a while,
I pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain,
Poor boy never say die,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill,
To strict party-platform ties,
He's wandered the earth an exiled man,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Old New York City is a friendly, old town,
Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people,
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you,
When God and man will be reconciled,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
She'll be coming forth,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
"Get well, get well, love Henry," she cried,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a rolling hoop,
You may be a preacher preaching spiritual pride,
The phone's tapped anyway,
Don't ever try to change me,
Pressing on,
Seven by seven they headed for heaven,
Analyze you, categorize you,
She was married when they first met to a man four times her age,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl,
Sara, Sara, it's all so clear, I could never forget,
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic,
The bridge at midnight trembles,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I been walking the road, I've been living on the edge,
Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah,
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote,
Like a rolling stone,
If you'd see me this a-way,
You lose yourself, but then you reappear,
I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Every brain is civilized,
Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down,
The one we can see and can feel,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
There's beauty in that rainbow in the sky,
He's out there preaching in front of the steeple,
Scale that wall and smoke that vine,
Well, my heart stopped beating, my hands turned cold,
Leave your stepping-stones behind, something calls for you,
You're blowing down the shaky street,
When it costs too much to build it at home,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Who among them, do you think, could resist you,
Might be reading "Art of Truth", might be outta luck,
He is centuries old,
Not a word was spoke between us, there was no risk involved,
They run to the water their buckets to fill,
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night,
I peeked behind the picture frame,
Old Reilly stole a stallion,
I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a trance,
This world is ruled by violence,
Too serious to fool,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed will cease,
The way, it is long, but the end is near,
Fools, they made a mock of sin,
My flashlight's from Taiwan,
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
Next animal that he did meet had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own,
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys,
Walking the streets down by the hacienda,
That somebody someplace oughtta be hearing,
And ain't in the pimple lotion people are selling you,
Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Well, he got no allies to really speak of,
Make you spin or do you in,
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
You angel, you, you got me under your wing,
There's a place––they call it Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street,
If you're traveling to the north country fair,
I said, "My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening,
"It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Slipping and sliding like a weasel on the run,
The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
And that three eyes cannot see him,
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
I noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind,
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Now, it's day and night the irons clang and, like poor galley slaves,
When you've lost everything, you'll have nothing left to hide,
And later on, when the crowd thinned out, I was just about to do the same,
Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Our conversation was short and sweet,
Wiggle till you're high, wiggle till you're higher,
And, no matter how you try, you just can't say it,
The call of the wild is forever at my door,
Dividing line ran through the center of town,
They'll stone you when you try to take a bath,
Sign on a porch says "Three's a Crowd",
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Well, my heart's in the Highlands wherever I roam,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
That four ears cannot hear him,
Till the tombstones of damage read no questions but, "Please,
I'm leaving today,
I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
To stay closer than any friend,
And your streets are getting empty,
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
All the tired horses in the sun,
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss,
You can run down to the desert,
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
There's a lonesome bell-tone in that valley of stone,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
Daddy's in the alley, he's looking for food,
And, if I can save you any time,
And the lion's mouth opens and you're staring at his teeth,
Better jump down a manhole,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be born,
Some things are too hot to touch,
If the wine don't come to the top of your cup,
Better jump down the manhole,
Well, well, well,
I can't see my reflection in the water,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
When I was in Missouri,
As easy it was to tell black from white,
I offered for salvation and they give me a lethal dose,
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic,
Yeah, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I got the heart and you got the blood,
New morning,
I can't cross the line, you know,
Farewell to the minutes they threaten you with it,
Looks like a-nothing but rain,
But whatever you wish to keep, you'd better grab it fast,
If I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
In the ruins of your balcony,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
That could hold you, dear lady, from going insane,
That, while life's pleasures be few,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole,
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
We cut through iron and we cut through mud,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Coffins dropping in the street like balloons made out of lead,
I fought with my twin, that enemy within,
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town,
And he carries all his money in a diamond-studded jar,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
If not for you, my sky would fall,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
When she lays upon the grass,
Drifting too far from shore,
Brighton girls are like the moon,
Don't let yourself fall,
Just to know that you are near,
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey,
The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band,
Driven deep beneath the waves,
While preachers preach of evil fates,
Yesterday is just a memory,
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children,
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
Alberta, don't you treat me unkind,
Father of grain, father of wheat,
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
And go out in your country where the land meets the sun,
All your reindeer armies, they're all going home,
You think she's yours to have and to hold,
Tolling for the aching, whose wounds cannot be nursed,
"Could you please not stare at me like that?" he said, "It's just my foolish pride,
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
Well, I quit my job, so I could work alone,
It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
Ten thousand men on the move,
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
Well, I may just swear,
I been meek and hard like an oak,
<i>Pink</i> that <i>dream</i> and nose that <i>dough</i>,
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding down the line,
Oh, well, everybody says you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
Maybe I'd'a saved some life that been lost,
When my life is over and my time has run out,
You can train on down to Williams Point,
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you're living in,
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord,
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space,
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm,
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
And the whole world is on your case,
I'd give you the sky high above,
I had a dream about you, baby,
Outsiders they can freely criticize,
I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep,
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
Well, she pulled off them long, blue gloves all made of the finest leather,
Where life and death are memorized,
Don't need a shot of turpentine – only bring me to my knees,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning,
The only thing I knew how to do was a-keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
Dupree came in pimping tonight to the Thunderbird Café,
The gallows' shadows shook the evening,
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
I'll buy you a [incomprehensible] skirt,
Dad's in a hallway looking hard for the fuze,
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside,
In this room the heat-pipes just cough,
On this curve I'm hanging, on this pathway I'm strolling,
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
And I'll join the bravest rankers there, Jack Donohue and Co.,
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Resent him to the bone,
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
God knows it's true,
A saxophone someplace played, she was walking on by the arcade,
To be on your own,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
Well, I told my baby, I said, "Baby, I know where you been,
Pull man down like a county hook, my man,
Don't know what to do without it,
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
Might be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball,
Don't show me no picture-show or give me no book to read,
Blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Move lightly from the ledge, babe,
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes all made of Spanish leather,
In the great unknown,
But I know God has mercy on them who're slandered and humiliated,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung,
Call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore,
Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin,
He saw an animal that liked to snort, horns on his head and they weren't too short,
Outside the lights were shining on the river of tears,
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand,
Ten thousand men on a hill,
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
Inside the museums infinity goes up on trial,
Be careful of the clean clothes,
Summer days, summer nights are gone,
Did he make it to the top? Well, he probably did and dropped,
At the mongrel dogs who teach,
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
You know––so nasty and you're so bad,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
You better duck down the alleyway,
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby,
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,
"She's waiting at home like a patient saint,
In the tune I'm humming, in the words that I'm thinking,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
In the end,
Them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked,
Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Her folks, they said that their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
Bow down to her on Sunday, salute her when her birthday comes,
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Whose ebony face is beyond communication,
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
The sweet, pretty things are in bed now of course,
Tell me that you love me only,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in,
They're spoon-feeding Casanova, get him to feel more assured,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
Well, I got up in the morning, looked under my bed,
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood,
Broken threads, broken springs,
My so-called friends have fallen under a spell,
Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
True love of mine,
This situation can only get rougher,
There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,
Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Oh, your mouth used to be so naked, your eyes used to be blue,
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people,
The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
And laughter down on Elizabeth Street,
Gargles in the rat-race choir,
He tried to find a way back into the life he left behind,
"Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
But now we've got weapons of a-chemical dust,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell,
A man in the corner approached me for a match,
Sleeping in the alley, sleeping in the dust,
Got nothing for you, I had nothing before,
At your feet – at your feet to convince you of your pain,
You say you're shaking and you're always a-breaking, but you know how hard you try,
It still ain't me, babe,
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day,
Keep your eyes wide – the chance won't come again,
And, though the line is cut,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply,
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong,
Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
Your own empty-handed army is all going home,
Never being able to separate the good from the bad,
I can't understand,
When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend,
Don't put yourself over the line,
There's only one step down from here, baby,
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
That long, black train is pulling down,
Like some mystery,
You took a part of me that I really miss,
Atlantic City, by the cold, grey sea,
Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
It frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be,
My comrades, they all loved me well – a jolly, saucy crew,
Just as far as my eyes can see,
In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
And the telling of his story, mean to let you know,
Automobile coming into style,
Now, Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Wiggle till you wiggle right outta here,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
I don't wanna fake you out,
Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
Oh, mama, is this really the end,
My captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled, and he's skilled,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
God knows there's a chance,
Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
Ten thousand women all dressed in white,
If you throw it all away,
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew,
But, if you ride back and I am left,
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls,
She's delicate and seems like the mirror,
Temptation's page flies out the door,
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin,
I want you so bad,
Now, won't you tell me true,
If she ain't feeling well,
She got great big hind legs,
Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
The judge, he's holding a grudge and he's about to call on you,
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf,
Two by two they stepped into the ark,
Made the woods around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady,
You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
Tell me, tell me before I go,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Searching everywhere I know,
She looking into my eyes, she's holding my hand,
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
God knows that, when you see it,
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery,
Well, the Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies,
I've been around this whole country,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a swarm of bees,
That'd ease you, dear lady, from going insane,
Crickets are chirping, the water is high,
Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Take me on a trip upon your magic, swirling ship,
No, you can't find it neither in no night-club, no yacht club,
Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
I'm in Boston town in some restaurant,
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through,
In the turning of twilight,
Last night the wind was whispering something, I's trying to make out what it was,
People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
The sky too is folding over you,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
They may call you "doctor" or they may call you "chief",
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down,
May be a rock-and-roll addict prancing on the stage,
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me,
It hurts me, too,
How he died nobody can say,
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she begin to want me,
All them prophets good and gone,
Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
You know, news of you has come down the line,
You better chew gum,
Just as long as you stay with me,
I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
And played the fife lowly,
My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war,
And your basement-clothes and your hollow face,
I don't build up illusion till it makes me sick,
One push of the button and a shot the world wide,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride,
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
I muttered something underneath my breath, she studied the lines of my face,
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill,
Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of a-Brooklyn mourned,
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs,
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
I'm living in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line,
"It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
There's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming,
I'll say goodbye to Colorado,
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena,
Mixing up the medicine,
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe,
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
You should be made to be wearing at all times a telephone,
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise,
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife,
Strange things have happened than ever before,
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy,
I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
He pushed the table over to protect his family,
But, though the rules of the road have been lodged,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
It's just a ragged clown behind,
Is used, it is plain,
Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
They'd like to drive me from this town,
Woke up this morning feeling blue,
I'm seeing your world of people and things,
I keep listening for footsteps, but I ain't ever hearing any,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
God knows there's a heaven,
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Baby, please stop crying,
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to foxtrot, lope, and pace,
I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
Look who's back in town,
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
Your brain is bleeding and your legs can't seem to stand,
But my heart is not weary, it's light and it's free,
You had enough of hatred,
All down in taken-for-granted situations,
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
God knows you've got to weep,
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
Now I've just got to cut loose before it gets late,
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
And I will not carry myself down to die,
Camping out all night on the veranda,
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet,
You have laid down Your life for me,
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
Like a dog on a chain,
They took his head and turned it inside out,
With her picture books of the pyramid and her postcards of Billy the Kid,
Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
Come on, come on, stick together,
You close your eyes and part your lips and slip your fingers from your glove,
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
He took dead-center aim, but he missed just the same,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
He been around the world and back again,
People tell me it's a crime to remember her for too long a time,
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear,
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all,
Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
Sing me one more song about your love into the morning, stranger,
Windows were shaking all night in my dreams,
May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift,
And it still ain't me, babe,
Gave three loud raps and a very big roar, uh-huh,
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
I'm drifting in and out of dreamless sleep,
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Come down the [incomprehensible], don't leave me behind,
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
There's a battle outside and it's raging,
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace,
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts,
So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Coming and going like a rabbit in the wood,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
For the disrobed, faceless forms of no position,
Underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Followed some clues from my detective bag,
Go away from my window,
Politician's got on his jogging shoes,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
I swung on to my old guitar,
And you're scared to your soul you just might forget it,
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
You can hurt someone and not even know it,
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Stone you when you're walking on the street,
You'll look back and wonder 'bout the bridges you have burned,
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite,
Don't follow leaders,
It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
Watch the plain-clothes,
Ms. Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is,
I went to see the gypsy staying in a big hotel,
"We'll meet on edges soon," said I,
And your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm,
They say, in your father's house there's many mansions,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone,
Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Now, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there as the night grows still,
God knows it's a crime,
She pulls one out from behind her ear,
By rivers of blindness,
In the instant that I preach,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
I just can't do what I've done before,
Well, the––Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Holding me back, not letting me stand,
Next to come in was a little, black tick,
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last,
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,
Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
Stone you when you are young and able,
And you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming,
Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
Puffing on a big cigar,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect,
Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery,
One by one they follow the sun,
There's only one road and it leads to Calvary,
Oh, singing just for you,
Ain't in the dime-store dummies and bubble-gum goons,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
They'll stone you when you're walking 'cross the floor,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
I would be crazy if I took you back,
There's mirrors inside the minds of crazy faces,
Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
May be sitting in a [incomprehensible] smoking pearl,
Not out of spite, nor anger,
I'm going back to Colorado,
The priest wore black on the seventh day, sat stone-faced while the building burned,
Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
I'm not the one you want, babe,
That fellow who never blushes,
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Yes, I'm leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift,
Oh, Angelina,
Uncle went riding, trip downtown, uh-huh,
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust,
Let me eat when I'm hungry, let me drink when I'm dry,
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
And, though it's only my opinion – I may be right or wrong,
Sometimes I have a nickel and sometimes I have a dime,
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the South,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page,
When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
But I know that he don't talk,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club,
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
When you're through running over things like you're walking 'cross the tracks,
As the daylight hours do increase,
"Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
Well, first to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er to be,
Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal,
Oh, the moon is shining bright, lighting everything in sight,
It always has hit me from below,
Keep me where you are,
They run a brick and tile company,
Look away, you rolling river,
So, I watched that sun come rising from the little Minnesota town,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
Might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread,
See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
They said "Aye" and away they rode,
The day you quit me, baby,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Broken hands on broken plows,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
Far away from it all,
Gonna change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
All that and more and then some,
That five walls cannot hide him,
Went out last night just to take a little round,
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity,
Well, it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand,
The country doctor rambles,
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
Some're masters of illusion, some're ministers of the trade,
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls,
I should have left this town this morning,
She's over 'bove the [incomprehensible] pad,
Had no one to go my bail,
You need something to open your eyes,
Who will judge the many when the game is through,
Well, the leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off of the shelf,
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
You hand in your money to go watch the geek,
Going, going,
Come, senators, congressmen, please heed the call,
Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables,
Cities on fire, phones outta order,
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb,
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan,
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it, then she hung it on a wall,
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea,
I'm a-going where the chilly winds don't blow,
And rivers that ran through every day,
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket,
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
The preacher talked 'bout Christ's betrayal,
Don't fall apart on me tonight,
The midnight rain follows the train,
Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Well, I just been to the baggage car where the engineer's been tossed,
For threatening my baby, unborn and unnamed,
And all the while he was alone, the past was close behind,
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
"The news of the day is on all the time,
So I drifted down to New Orleans, where I lucky was to be employed,
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night,
Ah, but, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
I saw a little chicken a-down on his knees,
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
All you can do is do what you must,
I've had my eyes on you, baby, for five long years,
That they do not respect in any degree,
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense,
When just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene,
You're the lamp of my soul, girl, and you torch up the night,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone,
But I could not hold on to her very long,
The palace of mirrors, where dog-soldiers are reflected,
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
Giving back all of what you owe,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
You can touch and twist and turn two kinds of doorknobs,
The empty rooms, where her memory is protected,
Memory, ecstasy,
With his pointed shoes and his bells,
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote,
Without your sweet love,
And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
And, though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow,
"Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
We always did love the very same one, we just saw her from a different point of view,
God bless them pretty women, I wish they was mine,
Or your eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming 'bout the way things a-really are,
Icicles hanging down,
Well, I just do what I'm told, so I did it of course,
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreaming,
I don't care if you analyze me,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
Eh, singing just for you,
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust,
I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Seem like, every time you stop and turn around,
Leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf,
She screamed till her face got so red, then she fell on the floor,
Without ideals or violence,
"We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
She said, "Now, don't you tell Henry,
You stole her love from me one day,
If I didn't have to guess,
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
Send for the doctor, who pull down the shade,
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake,
Sick man looking for the doctor's cure,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
Shadows are falling and I've been here all day,
They'd all fall there so perfectly,
My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
I'm sure your mind is roaming,
The only one my arms could ever hold,
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs,
Yeah, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed,
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,
Down the foggy ruins of time,
Took the wife and kids and started home,
You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain,
The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
Broken words never meant to be spoken,
They took a clean-cut kid,
Stone you when you're reaching for the door,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Private reasons, great or small,
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Someone to open each and every door,
We are covered in blood, girl, you know, both our forefathers were slaves,
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
Billy, you're so far away from home,
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry,
Yes, that's the story of the "Hurricane",
Ye shall be a-changed,
Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword,
Well, today's been a sad, old, lonesome day,
Our loyalty they tried to win,
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
Yes, I been gambling so long,
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
And we, having no money, paid them off in cracks,
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too,
Then they started to take back the clothes, hang 'em on the line,
I been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's wrong,
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet,
Well, I told my baby further down the line,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme,
You to me were true,
It might be the devil, it might be the Lord,
Oh, her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
You're still gonna have to serve somebody,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
You need a fast-flying train on a tornado track,
Each time we meet, love,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
Paradise, sacrifice,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason,
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight,
I just keep pressing on,
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range,
But something has changed,
Rabbit running down across the road,
Thieving in the alley,
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
"Take care of all of your memories," said Mick,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me,
But I would not feel so all alone,
You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
There's always been people that have to cause fear,
But that's what you need, man, and you need it bad,
And forget my pride,
If you got a lotta money, you can make yourself merry,
People talk of situations,
Who's never weak, but always strong,
That can do what's a-never been done,
Well, he rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door, uh-huh,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, you got nothing to lose,
Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
How he died nobody could say,
Well, children cry for mother, I tell 'em, "Mother took a trip",
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
Well, it's up in the morning trying to find a job of work,
My hands didn't touch him none,
Last night I danced with a stranger,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
Now, after weeks and weeks of hanging around,
You have given me life to live,
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement,
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
Seven days zipping and blowing,
Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Now, don't crowd me, lady, or I'll fill up your shoe,
Now, he looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette,
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
Broken bodies, broken bones,
Her passport shows a face from another time and place, she looks a-nothing like that,
Cast down from heaven and he's out of his head,
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
The winter would hold no spring,
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
He had a steady job, he joined the choir,
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn,
So, all you newsy people, spread the news around,
If tonight was not a crooked trail,
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real,
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away,
You walk into the room like a camel and then you frown,
No one in front of me and nothing behind,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
Father of night, father of day,
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Adiós, mi corazón,
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
You're beautiful beyond words,
And it ain't made in no fat kid's fraternity house,
The deputy walks on a-hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
I own you're a maid I love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while,
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
You might a janitor out on the [incomprehensible],
You can step on my name, you can try and get me beat,
Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
I wish to my soul I had seven years, uh-huh,
I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right,
Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I've heard all of them rumors and you have heard 'em, too,
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Is looking for a new fool,
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
In the shadows of moonlight,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
And all that you've held sacred falls down and does not mend,
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
But, if you want me to,
Broken lines, broken strings,
You may call me Bobby or you may call me Zimmy,
It don't matter no more what you got to say,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
I had no one for to go my bail,
To hate them and fear them, to run and to hide,
To make all that should be killed to crawl,
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
Like a complete unknown,
Blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud,
Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Oh, I miss my darling so, I didn't mean to see her go,
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
I'm rolling slow, I'm doing all I know,
Well, everybody's building their boats,
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn't do,
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
In one the surface was frozen,
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the D train,
Some are mathematicians, some are doctors' wives,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
While paupers change possessions,
You got something better,
With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
At ships with tattooed sails,
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note,
Whatever colors you have in your mind,
I've been walking forty miles of bad road,
May be a city councilman taking bribes on the side,
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies,
And it's true sometime, you could see it that way,
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
And, if I see the day,
Badge out, laid off,
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high,
When Ruthie says come see her in her honky-tonk lagoon,
They are spoon-feeding Casanova to get him to feel more assured,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
If we never meet again, baby, remember me,
To be so useless and all,
I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring,
Broken pipes, broken tools,
"No, I never did engage in this kinda thing before,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke,
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved,
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
Ring them bells, sweet Martha, for the poor man's son,
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways,
And, before you can count from one to ten, do it all over again,
For something that he never done,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
They lowered him down as a king,
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever,
Yes, I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes,
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand,
Come gather 'round, people, wherever you roam,
Nothing a-really matters much, doom alone that counts,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
One time ago a crazy dream came to me,
God knows it's fragile,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Well, you can read out your Bible,
It's many a night I pretended to be a-sleeping,
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast,
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole,
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
Human gods aim for their mark,
While riding on a train going west,
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind,
Every head is so dignified,
You gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Looking for a new fool,
am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told,
A dream about you, baby,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
I couldn't see where we were going,
You were snow, you were rain,
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
You and me, we had completeness,
Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Far past the frozen leaves,
Distant ships sailing in through the mist,
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
I'll forsake my husband too for the love of Blackjack Davey,
I am a man of constant sorrow,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
She was working in the blinding light and I stopped in for a drink,
Ring them bells, St. Catherine, from the top of the room,
Of ancient history,
I've been in and out of happiness,
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
Yes, the wedding bells're ringing and the choir's beginning to sing,
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,
Not supposed to fight back and have thick skin,
Can lead you to hundred-dollar plates,
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl,
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
With objects and material things, but I never was impressed,
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain falling on my shoes,
I thank the Lord,
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all,
I'm never, never far from home,
My woman's never sitting at home,
All along this countryside he opened many a door,
Heart of mine, go back where you been,
I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill,
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Judge said to the jury, "Plain as a thing can be,
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
Strong men belittled by doubt,
"I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
And you search in vain to find just one law-abiding citizen,
With no direction home,
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
No, no, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
I just walk along and stroll and sing,
Preoccupied with his vengeance,
Love don't have any place,
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost,
Mr. Jinx and Ms. Lucy, they jumped in the lake,
That knows your troubles a hundred times over,
Tell me now with a glance or a sigh,
You been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,
He said, "I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,
And you're tired trying to get out of – of situations,
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
And your gravity's down and negativity don't get you through,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
If anything is gonna sell,
Need a woman [incomprehensible],
The wind, it whispers to the buckeye trees in rhyme,
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
Is it really any wonder,
Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
Searching high, searching low,
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
She takes about fifteen baths a day,
They'll stone you when you try to be so brave,
Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go,
She said she would always stay,
Well, they used to grow food in Kansas,
Coming down the road for a country mile or two,
He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
The beat is pumping,
When I seen him lose control,
Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Hoping to get you behind a wood piling,
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
I've dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss,
Lord, I got the worried blues,
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,
Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like a bowl of soup,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
And, when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn,
"Not us," said the angry crowd,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Carved next to his name,
If not for you,
How does it feel,
He hands you a nickel, then he hands you a dime,
Gonna serve somebody,
Feel like my soul has turned into steel,
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
Said I'm pressing on,
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases,
It wasn't me that made him fall,
First to come in was the flying moth,
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say,
She's crying like an evil stone,
Where mercy walks the plank,
Don't know what you got that I want, don't know what I got to give,
The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
But, to remain as friends,
And ye shall be a-changed,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some boy she could destroy,
Poisoned in the bushes, blown out on the trail,
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
Or do you remember St. James Street,
Each one playing a horn,
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much, love,
It was a girl I learned it from,
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
And you make love just like a woman,
When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans,
No time to lose or say goodbye,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
"So, take heed, take heed of the western winds,
A change in the weather can be extreme,
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you where the lion lies down with the lamb,
Genghis Khan, he could not keep all his kings supplied with sleep,
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten,
You may be standing there with a tear in your eye,
"Oh, I'm sailing away, my own true love,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
I landed up on the downtown side,
A worried man with a worried mind,
Well, I'm driving in the flats in a Cadillac car,
I been good while I been waiting,
Now, his holiest books have been trampled upon,
Oh, the gates are cast iron and the walls are barbed wire,
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners,
I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Give to me your lily-white hand and we'll go home together,
Stopped into a renovated hotel with a neon burning bright,
Sara, oh, Sara, Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
In the days of old when we dug up the gold, how ofttimes I repine,
Don't let yourself stumble,
Please see if her hair hangs long,
Me and my baby walking down the street,
Every time you leave and go off some place,
Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
You follow, find yourself at war,
"Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
I long to see you in the morning light,
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A., watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news,
There was a wicked messenger – from Eli he did come,
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Over the fields where the good shepherd grieves,
Tomorrow's just one step beyond,
God knows there's a purpose,
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
I ran into the fortune-teller, she said beware 'cause of lightning might strike,
Hazel, stardust in your eye,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity in secret for pieces of change,
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez,
I don't need no alibi when I'm spending time with you,
He saw an animal as smooth as glass slithering his way through the grass,
Well, the job that you used to have,
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow will offer their heads for a prayer,
Eyed through the <i>I Ching</i> yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the whelm,
You've thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow, uh-huh,
Living on your country or jobs offered you,
One push of the button, then a shot the world wide,
They walked along by the old canal, little confused – I remember well,
Didn't come close to a mountain,
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup,
High water rising, rising night and day,
Someone showed me a picture, I just had to laugh,
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Oh, the age of the inmates I remember quite freely,
She smiled all in her countenance, said, "They call me Jack-A-Roe,
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone,
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
To see the promised land with me as the time go by,
Next to come in was the bumbly bee,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Three angels up above the street,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
And I'm in the shade,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
And then a whistle will be blowing,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Corrina, Corrina,
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look,
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
I need something strong to distract my mind,
It wasn't us that made him fall,
I ain't looking to block you up,
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
And Madonna, she still has not showed,
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Wise man looking in a blade of grass,
Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
If I'd'a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me woulda died,
Yes, we'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
They said "Congratulations, you got what it takes",
Name of Martin Luther King,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
She's away and westward-bound, far above the clouds she'll fly,
The whole earth, in progression, seems to pass by,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
I'd ask him what the matter was,
But the funniest thing was, when I was leaving the bay,
Well, I can't understand,
And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Some are mathematicians, some are carpenters' wives,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I'm using 'em all,
Gonna have to serve somebody,
Yes, you're right from your side and I'm right from mine,
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Well, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
With great lawyers and scholars you've discussed lepers and crooks,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue,
I went out last night to take a little round,
She walked up to me so gracefully, took my crown of thorns,
And I just turn my back while you silently die,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
You see me on the street, you always act surprised,
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the day-times I repine,
Stone you when you're waiting for a train,
My love, she speaks softly,
All the silver, all the gold,
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek,
I run the tape back in my mind wondering if I took the wrong road somewhere,
They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
I'd already gone the distance,
I got those worried blues,
And your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head,
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes,
The motorcycle, Black Madonna,
Well, it may be the devil and it may be the Lord,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
It's true, I just can't recall San Francisco at all,
Or select you or dissect you,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
And there he spied his darling bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey,
She'll do wondrous a-works with your fate,
I tried to reach you, honey,
Next to come in was Mrs. Cow,
Where we together weathered many a storm,
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
You've got to serve somebody,
And his jaws start closing with you underneath,
Fanning the flames on the furnace of desire,
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand,
Somebody better explain, she's got her iron chain,
Let the dead bury the dead, your time will come,
Everybody's out there feeding the pigeons out on the limb,
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,
You can have the best there is, but it's gonna cost you all your love,
You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
He oversees his kingdom so no stranger does intrude,
They put me on a train and they brought me back,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle all dressed in green,
Daddy's in the hallway looking for the fuze,
Every moon is so sanctified,
And the windows are rattling and breaking, your rooftops're shaking,
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off,
I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun,
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
Long distance operator, please place this call, you know, it's not for fun,
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Read books and repeat quotations,
"Ah, but I just thought you might want something fine,
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
When a war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets,
The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
You can raise up your right hand,
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves,
They said, "Listen, boy, you're just a pup",
Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
He took Ms. Mousey on his knee, uh-huh,
Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk,
And may you stay forever young,
The country I come from is called the Midwest,
Father who teacheth the bird to fly,
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like satin and silk,
Now, Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
Curtis looking high, Curtis looking low,
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy,
Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing,
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,
As I went out one morning to breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
You may be a businessman or some high-degree thief,
Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
Heard your songs of freedom and man, forever stripped,
Most of the time she ain't even in my mind,
And he drifted down to New Orleans where they treated him like a boy,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Well, the whole earth is asleep,
And your train-engine fire needs a new spark to catch it,
You know there's no drug that'll do for the healing,
When a horror broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
The man in the trench-coat,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
I think we better talk this over,
Where wisdom grows up in strife,
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door,
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive,
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
But the enemy I see wears a cloak of decency,
Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall,
I was born in Dixie in a boomer's shack,
Mama, put my guns in the ground,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
Oh, come all without, yeah, come all within,
Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
I went into the city, went into the town,
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Dust on my face and my cape,
Little red wagon, little red bike,
Babe, please come crawl out your window,
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair,
The Communists was a-coming around,
I would not feel so all alone,
I'm crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
I'll say, "It's easily done,
Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
'Cause he sinned, I got no choice, it run in my vein,
I can't be good, baby,
Take the motherless children off the street,
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
Reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
I was thinking 'bout turquoise, I was thinking 'bout gold,
Spent my money on you, honey,
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Well, underneath that tree there's just gonna be you and me,
Cat's moo and calf's meow, you know, I––I can recite them all,
Here comes the story of the "Hurricane",
Sailing down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans,
Who among them would try to impress you,
Roll, Willie, roll,
My love, she speaks like silence,
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
Gypsy undertaker sighs, the lonesome-organ grinder cries,
Alright, I'm so glad,
His name was Willie O'Conley and he gambled all his life,
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise,
Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer,
Just don't know what to do,
Yes, and I'll go last,
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
Pulled my cap down over my eyes,
He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Most of the time I'm clear-focused all around,
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
She leave by the other and roam,
You're beautiful to me,
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull,
Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
Need something special–need something special, alright,
But, if I can save you any time,
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude,
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so,
And your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
Honeybees are buzzing, leaves begin to stir,
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down,
You angel, you, you're as f––got me under your wing,
It was from her ship sailing,
Nine by nine they drank the wine,
God sees it all unfold,
I heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening,
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you,
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone,
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
Oh, set me down on a television floor,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
Or was it a day? I truly don't know –,
And our ship was high upon the sea when pirates came along,
Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired,
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don't have all that much time,
Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Well, if you don't want to see me,
When the children were babies and played on the beach,
This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
She say, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you",
Would you forsake your husband too to go with Blackjack Davey,
They sat together in the park as the evening sky got dark,
Some people will offer you their hand and some won't,
We learn to live and then we forgive,
I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out west,
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green, grassy leaves,
You made it there somehow,
If I could hear her heart a-softly pounding,
Stay far from the fence with the 'lectricity sting,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
I get my sweet reward,
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
A true love of mine,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
Might be a conductor flagging down a train,
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind,
Oh, watered-down love,
Dad's in the hallway looking hard for the fuze,
Where peace is not welcome at all,
I started out on burgundy, but soon hit the harder stuff,
Who could they get to carry you,
Relationships of ownership,
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray,
My existence led by confusion boats,
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plaît",
Sends for the doctor, pulls down the shade,
I don't wanna straight-face you,
Trying to peel the moon and expose it,
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
Well, the ocean took my baby,
Far away in the stormy night,
Every little sound just might be thunder,
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're getting ready for the feast,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong,
All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
I can make it through,
I met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues,
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
Yesterday's just a memory,
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them,
There's a kingdom called Heaven, a place where there is no pain of birth,
Trust yourself,
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Her folks, they said their lives together sure was gonna be rough,
I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
Well, my ship's been split to splinters and it's sinking fast,
Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a .44,
Just then Tom Paine himself came running from across the field,
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
But, when we meet again and are introduced by friends,
Blind man breaking out of a trance,
Got a little girl, her name is Ball,
"Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast,
'Cause you look and you start getting the chills,
But she's drifting like a satellite,
But he's the property of Jesus,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
First to come in was the flying moth, uh-huh,
That, as long as it takes to do this,
I'm gonna let you pass,
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer,
Oxford Town in the afternoon,
That the laws are with him,
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced,
Searching for the truth the way God designed it,
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows,
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
And furnish me with tape,
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
King of the streets, child of clay,
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare,
Got out of bed and put his clothes back on, pushed back the blind,
Maybe someday you'll be satisfied,
There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived,
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are,
You just ain't a-gonna find it on your ticket stub,
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
And also by his feet,
At your feet to convince you of your pain,
You might be hungry, you might be [incomprehensible],
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell,
And I'm so glad,
Newspapermen eating candy,
Saved,
It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
So, now I'm going back again, I got to get to her somehow,
Can't find what I need,
Tears on the letter that I write,
There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
There's a long distance train rolling through the rain,
And they––they look at me and frown,
Isis, oh, Isis, you're a mystical child,
I begun to think what a deed I'd done,
Well, I's sitting home alone and I started to sweat,
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride,
Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer,
And he just smoked my eyelids,
Looking 'bout the government,
Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
You need something to open up a new door,
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
Thinking and drinking that they got it made,
The night blows cold and rainy,
Holding his club like he was a king,
Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go,
We'll fly the night away,
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
All your seasick sailors, they're all rowing home,
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave,
I got my mind made up,
Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Honeysuckle blooming in the wild-wood air,
They walk among the stately trees,
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
Oh, some of us will wind up in St. Cloud Prison,
I'm walking through streets that are dead,
To push fake morals, insult, and stare,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
Sign on a street says "You Don't Own Me",
Speak jealously of them that are free,
Going,
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Go melt back in the night,
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Up on Housing Project Hill it's either fortune or fame,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
Sometimes feel so low-down and disgusted,
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody,
Now I've just got to go before I get to the ledge,
With his fist in a clinch,
We live and we die, we know not why,
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
You even make love just like a woman,
Got no place to fade, got no coat,
The police department hounded him, they called him "Mr. Smith",
And maybe kept him from his fate,
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
The meaning of the life has been lost in the wind,
My tablecloth's from Malaysia,
The sky too is folding under you,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing "Memphis in June",
And I got the worried blues,
To the marketplace, merchants and thieves hungry for power,
Yes, I'm pressing on,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
My hands can't feel to grip,
The answer is blowing in the wind,
Friends with you,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
I'm not asking you to say words like "yes" or "no",
Where do you look for this oil-well gushing,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
If your time to you is worth saving,
From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem,
Yes, I'm so glad,
My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Scratch your dad, do that bird,
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
Ain't no use jiving, ain't no use joking,
Exchanging all the precious gifts and things,
It's rising up above my head,
Ten thousand women all sweeping my room,
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
Curtis in the jailhouse drinking from an old tin cup,
Mama's in the factory, ain't got no shoes,
In his anger and his shame,
And they drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west,
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
But I never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell,
Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates,
For she ain't the same,
He had a job in the old North Woods, working as a cook for a spell,
Down boulevards of broken cars,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
Oh, where is Little Maggie? Over yonder she stand,
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,
Well, your streets are getting empty,
There's beauty in that silver, singing river,
With his candle lit into the sun,
Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
And the ladies treat me kindly and they furnish me with tape,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
Frankie got down upon her knees, took a-Albert into her lap,
Oh, you gone to the finest school, alright, Ms. Lonely,
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes made of Spanish leather,
Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
Yes, and you, I see you're still with her. Well,
God knows it's terrifying,
To your tambourine in time,
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
You prayed to the Lord above, oh, please send you a friend,
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote,
All I remember was a moaning sound,
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied,
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you, but, no, you will not be deceived,
Me and my gal, my gal's son,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, gotta quit your mess and straighten out,
Whether you are right or wrong,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
She saw that hanging branch a-bending,
And it ain't me, babe,
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
I did it for – because he lied, 'cause he took you for a ride,
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,
She's delicate, she seems like the mirror,
It ain't in the cardboard-box house,
Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
I march in the parade of liberty,
May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace,
Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
Just remember that death is not the end,
Get dressed, get blessed,
You took the silver, you took the gold,
'Stead of going back off to sea and leaving me to meditate,
The words fill my head and fall to the floor,
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist,
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend,
He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
You can listen to my story, you can listen to my song,
Ye shall be changed,
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms,
And that pretty, dancing girl, she could not be found,
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras,
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
You say my kisses are not like his,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
Early one morning the sun was shining, he was lying in bed,
Grandpa died last week and now he's buried in the rocks,
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
Couldn't imagine nothing else,
In a pine box for all eternity,
Yes, I want you so bad,
You may be a state trooper, you might be a Young Turk,
Well, the wind, it was howling and the snow was outrageous,
She walked up to me so gracefully and she took my crown of thorns,
Tell-tale heart will show itself to anybody near,
Night-sticks and water-cannons, tear gas, padlocks,
And watch the young torero stand alone,
I hurt easy, I just don't show it,
I couldn't believe after all these years you didn't know me any better than that,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
By users, cheaters,
Well, I'm sitting on my watch so I can be on time,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
Your mother says I'm a stranger,
Cares not to come up any higher,
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
"I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
The light I never knowed,
Maybe when we both get sober,
"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby,
I went to get some help. I walked by a Guernsey cow,
That can do what's never been done,
I got a house on the hill, I got hogs all out in the mud,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
The day would surely have to break,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
To know that some other man is holding you tight,
But you're gonna serve somebody,
And he's taught how to walk in a pack,
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Don't let me change my heart,
But he practiced what he preached from the heart,
You angel, you, you're as fine as can be,
Over your senses you have no control,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
They're all drinking, thinking that they got it made,
Heading out for the East Coast – Lord knows, I've paid some dues getting through,
I can drink like a fish, I can crawl like a snake,
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
"Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
There's been rumors of war and wars that have been,
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed,
He saw an animal that liked to growl, big furry paws and he liked to howl,
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking,
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear,
And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
Might be living in a mansion, you might live in a dome,
Judge and jury took their stand,
Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Uncle Rat went running downtown, uh-huh,
Well, I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink,
Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
Dead man, dead man, when will you arise,
Señor, Señor, can you tell me where we're heading,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
To be––direction home,
Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
I pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud,
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue,
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
She was working in a topless place and I stopped in for a beer,
I'm a sweet bourbon daddy and tonight I am blue,
Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home,
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse,
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coat,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died,
You have given all there is to give,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
But you and I, we've been through that and this is not our fate,
Noontime and I'm still on the road, on the darkest part,
It can't get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked,
My grandfather was a duck trapper, he could do it with just dragnets and ropes,
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing,
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille 'neath the moonshine, bloody and pink,
Well, the way I love that woman,
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
A thousand miles from home,
I went back to see the gypsy, it was nearly early dawn,
Ring them bells, St. Peter, where the four winds blow,
Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Father of time and father of dreams,
My conscience is beginning to bother me today,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle,
No matter what you're doing, if you start giving up,
My dear, sweet friend,
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released,
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around,
I've been living the blues every night without you,
Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
"Without my uncle Rat's consent," – uh-huh,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops,
Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Someday you'll learn when her love grows cold,
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Eh, in somebody's room,
When there is no more,
Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Stay right with it when the road unwinds,
Now everything's a little upside down – as a matter of fact, the wheels've stopped,
Written by an Italian poet from the fifteenth century,
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns,
And make all kinds of money and chicks,
To hang and to lynch,
Next to come in was the Juney bug, uh-huh,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
The kingdoms of experience,
All that's gold doesn't shine,
Three by three they're turning the key,
In order to get in a word with you, I'd a-have to come up with some excuse,
And they'll raise their hands, saying, "We'll meet all your demands",
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
The carpet too is moving under you,
I can smile in the face of mankind,
There's a-mighty many people in the middle and all around,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
She talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
I'm so glad,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
'Twas down in Chaynee County, a time they talk about,
A finger fired the trigger to his name,
I can change, I swear,
He's young and on fire,
"Oh, son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
I got a God-fearing woman, one I can easily afford,
Of this I can't say very much,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Life is sad, life is a bust,
Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets,
Oh, all my fathers, they've gone down,
Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
In the slow-motion crawl or life's busy race,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
For the politician's gain,
I'll be on my way,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere,
They pass by so silently,
Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up,
Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of a-who knows when,
Now, we heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex,
A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
I couldn't see how you could know me,
Though they murdered six million, in the ovens they fried,
I got this graveyard woman, you know, she keeps my kids,
And admit that the waters around you have grown,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
I knew right away he was not ordinary,
Oh, see what you can do,
He woke up and she was gone, he didn't see nothing but the dawn,
They––they show me to the door,
Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
She was working in a topless place, I stopped in for a beer,
Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks,
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
Too weary to talk and too tired to sing,
Poor boy in the hotel called the "Palace of Gloom",
There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back,
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
Looked behind the sink and under the floor,
Late one day in the middle of the week,
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Well, the medicine man come and then he shuffles inside,
Little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
Idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground,
And take me disappearing through the smoke-rings of my mind,
"Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief,
Smell the tail of the dragon,
Vanished from my hand,
Felt that emptiness inside to which he just could not relate,
Going down the back roads, heading south,
He's criticized and condemned for being alive,
Well, feeling like I just climbed outta my casket,
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Do what the captain says, lotta medals you will get,
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind,
Oh, you been with the professors and they've all liked your looks,
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
Seen you in the door-way, I seen you in the park,
No, no, no, it sure ain't me, babe,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane,
When he drifted down to LA, where he'd reckoned to try his luck,
Except of course the little neighbor-boy, who carried him to rest,
Stone you and say good luck,
And your pleasure knows no limits, your voice is like a meadowlark,
I don't want to meet your kin,
Face full of black soot,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Where the neon madmen climb,
But now morning is clear,
It's undeniable what they'd have you to think,
Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
That foreign sound in your ear,
I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Gave to him her lily-white hand and say good-bye forever,
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale,
Give what I got until I got no more,
She was married when they first met, soon to be divorced,
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
Ain't no going back,
Invading my privacy and making my decisions for me,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
Straight was the track to the top of the hill,
Hear a voice crying "Daddy!" I always think it's for me,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
But, you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
You always said people don't do what they believe in,
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow,
One look at you and I'm out of control,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
For the countless, confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse,
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow,
See them big plantations burning, hear the cracking of the whips,
Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
It was late one evening during a poker game,
May be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair,
May be an actor in a plot,
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer,
And there's one last favor I'll ask of you,
I'm gonna spare the defeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
And, if breath to you is worth saving,
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping,
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the "Goddess of Gloom",
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
"Gentlemen," he said, "I don't need your organization,
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Your babies're crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain,
I got no place left to turn,
I been riding the midnight train,
If I could only hear her heart a-softly pounding,
If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
Them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well,
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last,
But, all the while I was alone, the past was close behind,
Roses are red, violets are blue,
Then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above,
Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped,
The tragic figure. her sister did shout,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
True love, they've been without it,
Sleeping in the [incomprehensible] on the back of the dust,
God knows how to make it flow,
Now, the deputy walks on hard nails, preacher rides a mount,
"I know my waist is slender and my fingers, they are small,
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe,
In the shadows of the Mesa she will lead you,
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule,
There's a chain gang on the highway, I can hear them rebels yell,
Come, you ladies and you gentlemen, listen to my song,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool,
"Not me," said the boxing writer,
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around,
Well, I've already had two beers, I'm ready for the broom,
You think you know the smile on her lips,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,
And the executioner's face is always well-hidden,
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
God don't call it wrong,
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing,
Well, George Lewis told the Englishman, the Italian, and the Jew,
All along the watchtower princes kept the view,
But you need it badly and it lays on the street,
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand,
To rule my heart with sweetness and boldness from on high,
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high,
The reason for fighting I never did get,
Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
And there's two white horses following me,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
I got two white horses following me,
A handle hid out in the dark,
When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
The desk clerk said, "It happens every day",
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Señor, Señor, I can see that painted wagon,
John the Baptist, after torturing a thief,
All my fathers, they've gone down,
They tell me every man must fall,
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
He rode right up to Ms. Mousey's door,
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
And the table's full and overflowed,
Carry the New York Times,
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train,
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Just what you're gonna say when you get home,
My arms and legs were broken,
So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Pounced with fire on flaming roads,
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people,
Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
And the breeze will cease to be breathing,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
If the bible is right, the world will explode,
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
May be working in the wind down to the town,
It blows their minds most bitterly,
Blowing through the curtains in your room,
Ophelia, she's 'neath the window, for her I feel so afraid,
Makes no difference where she's been,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
You used to ride the chrome horse with your diplomat,
Change my way of thinking, bring myself a different set of rules,
"Give me a thousand policemen, throw me into a cell,
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart,
They say every man needs protection,
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,
And it ain't on a real rich kid's road-map,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
There's a woman I long to touch and I'm missing her so much,
There she come, now, down my way,
No llores, mi querida, Díos nos vigila,
I pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would've stayed home,
My feet were splintered, and my head was cracked,
I grabbed my hat and away I'd run,
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time,
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back,
I think I'll go out and go for a walk --
That's where you belong --
Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
From darkness dreams are deserted --
I can't see us going anywhere, girl --
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
You know, a woman like you should be at home --
Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Democracy don't rule the world --
And I pass by from town to town, they call me the Rambling Sign --
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed --
The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
Gal, you're on my mind.
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground.
But it was more than I could do.
Ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
Won't fall upon them naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.
I said, "Where are we going?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
Pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Ooh, for the touch of your love.
Well, the real truth is that I may be afraid to find it.
Oh, the rag-man draws circles up and down the block.
That he's tall, dark, and handsome and you're holding his hand.
For he was always known to lend a helping hand.
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime.
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
The answer is blowing in the wind.
All inside the walls on the grounds of Red Wing.
And all I see are dark eyes.
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.
Somewhere so high above this wall.
And you only got ten.
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
The newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night – you can have the morning, too.
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
You know, if you didn't wanna be with me, that you didn't have to stay.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid to get into any kind of wind.
Lord, Lord, I'm bound to die trying.
Telling everybody 'bout the chief of police.
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do.
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool.
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled.
May you have a strong foundation when the winds of changes shift.
It's called the land of permanent bliss.
Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.
And, while everybody knelt to pray, the drifter did escape.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers, old men turning young daughters into whores.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
And old Mr. Rockefeller never says a word.
I had so little time to fail.
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
Well, if I fall down dying, you know, she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
The waitress, he was handsome. He wore a powder-blue cape.
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Somebody's got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me.
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.
Is just equality in school.
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
Go to the ends of the earth for you to make you feel my love.
But you're gonna have to serve somebody.
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.
Because everybody must get stoned.
Don't trust me to show you beauty when beauty may only turn to rust.
You're gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can't make love all by yourself.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
I once loved a girl. Her skin, it was bronze.
May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you.
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.
Honey, I can't tell right from wrong.
Odeleyee-hoo-hoo-hoo.
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.
For the child that cries when the innocence dies.
Make me proud to know you wear the gun.
Blood on your saddle.
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
In one of them coffeehouses on the block.
But, now, lord God, let my poor voice be heard.
But you break just like a little girl.
I don't even know why we come.
Rain would gather, too.
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air.
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
As she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.
Struck down by the strength of the will.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
But tonight no moonlight will shine on me.
Humming all the drivers with my lullaby.
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed.
You'd know what a drag it is to see you.
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
For her parasite sister I had no respect.
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you've done.
You find out you can always lose a little more.
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
To keep her from the howling winds.
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.
I can walk anytime around the block.
So I turned on my Conelrad.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear someone thinks they really found you.
He said, "There's a body I'm trying to find.
All because his face was brown.

Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
Don't remember one thing more.
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
But that's what I am paid to do.
As the stars fell down and the moons fade away on Black Diamond Bay.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sail, so I made it back to the ship.
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
But you're not even sure what it is.
Try to avoid the scandals.
I want you.
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town.
But I guess that's better left unsaid.
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
Strap yourself to the tree with roots, you ain't going nowhere.
'Bout an East Coast city that you all know well.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to ride your passenger train.
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
Never wanted to go home till the last cent was lost.
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
Oh, got my mind made up.
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
That last night I was with.
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Long, black, shaggy hair hanging in her face.
But there's a slow – yeah, there's a slow – there's a slow train coming.
You say you're shaking and you're always aching, but you know how hard you try.
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards.
They overtook me down in Jericho.
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.
For an instant hand touched hand.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.
And the morning will be breaking.
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Then sends 'em out to the jungle.
With gold and silver in her hand.
It's unbelievable you can get this rich this quick.
Well, I'm standing on the table, I'm proposing a toast to the king.
Now I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company.
Just to take somebody's money away.
Well, I might look like Robert Ford, but I feel just like Jesse James.
My baby took my heart from me.
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously.
Lord, your highway's getting filled.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay.
My toes, too numb to step, wait only for my boot-heels to be wandering.
Preacherman seeks the same -- who'll get there first is uncertain.
I see you kiss her on the cheek every time she gives a speech.
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
It's so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
And I guess he'd been there for the whole night or more.
It's just the same as talking to you.
Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron where beauty and pleasure were known.
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
Everybody had a ticket for the trip.
A true love of mine.
But to search for love, that ain't no more than vanity.
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
The driver came in after you left, he gave 'em all to me and then he resigned.
You say you got some other kinda lover and, yes, I believe you do.
Everything about you is bringing me misery.
That's where I'll be when I get called home.
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this.
Whatever's waiting in the future could be what you're running from in the past.
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen.
He feeds off of everyone that a-he can touch.
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
But she just reminded me you were the one.
Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
I can't hear you anymore.
And relive my dreams.
Got to have done some evil deed.
Well, I'm pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
Hope that it don't sleet.
To hold me in your arms.
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
I already told you, won't tell you again.
In the palace of the Pope.
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
I was thinking 'bout Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.
Everybody's gone but me and you and I can't be the last to leave.

Streets up there're lined with gold.
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well.
I'm still punching cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe.

But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
She studies me closely as I sit down.
It always does when you're with me.
As the island slowly sank, the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
My old man, he's like some feudal lord, got more lives than a cat.
That's really and truly an American.
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Looking for a new friend.
There's a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle.
You rise up and say goodbye to no one.
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
Steal a lot and they make you king.
But I ain't got Corrina.
Even the softest touch.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound, I've seen 'nough heartache and strife.
Yes, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
Now, mark what followed and what did betide for it being on Christmas morning.
Tell me where it a-hurts you, honey, and I'll tell you who to call.
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.
Billy, you're so doggone far away from home.
The light I never knowed.
Tumbled all down into pieces.
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
And I thought of a goddess of beauty, the blooming, bright star of Bright Isle.
At the sorority sisters' home.
And you–you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
Well, I got back, took the parking ticket off the mast.
My baby told me I would have to go.
For the times, they are a-changing.
With the twang of the arrow and the snap of the bow.
Let me die on this land 'fore I die underground.
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
Blues wrapped around my head.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
I'm ready when you are, Señor.
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town.
All the money you made will never buy back your soul.

He's got his mother's eyes.
We flung them as far as we could in the tide.
Please don't take away my highway shoes.
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside. A tear came to his eye.
I said that.
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
Something else just a-hit the ground.
With your golden loom.
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Turn, turn to the rain and the wind.
Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case.
He was her man, he done her wrong.
Louise, she's alright, she's just near.
Ever since I seen her smile.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
'Steada acting like we never met.
I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
And, if it don't work out, you'll be the first to know.
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
And a pathway that leads up to the stars.
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me.

After losing every battle.
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
In the summertime when you were with me.
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
There's a guy I gotta see.
The Phantom of the Opera in a perfect image of a priest.
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.
Everybody says she's the brains behind pa.
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
She looked like she stepped out of The Dolce Vita.
When he was ten years old, he had a watermelon stand.
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.
It don't satisfy the hurt inside, nor the habit that I feed.
Ate up all of the wedding cake, uh-huh.
Stone you, they'll be back again.
Oh, yes, they did.
And there was no man around who could track or chain him down.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
Come on, baby.
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war.
So, darling, you better come through.
How can you say you love someone else? You know it's me all the time.
The empress attracts you, but oppression distracts you, it makes you feel violent and strange.
A lover for your life and nothing more.
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
Happen for days, didn't know your name.
You talk to her, she's your lover now.
Our chances really was a million to one.
There's no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike.
Things fall to pieces in my face.
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.
Broken voices on broken phones.
Mama, take this badge off of me.
Unthought of, though, somehow.
And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
And it's alright, ma, I can make it.
Maybe, then, you'll realize what it would've taken to keep me cool.
The beauty parlor's filled with sailors, the circus is in town.
And your flashing diamond teeth.
Nobody can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.
Now you stand here expecting me to remember something you forgot to say.
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.
You're the only love I've ever known.
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, he––nobody was glad.
That backs up their views, but your face is so bruised.
And rivers that ran through every day.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. "It's bad for your health," he said.
In this thing she called a good, old-fashioned war.
If it just don't make me hurts.
The fog is so thick that you can't even spy the land.
With twenty pounds of headlines stapled to his chest.
You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes.
It don't matter anyhow.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
And the pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles.
Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
I hope you're ready.

And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk.

It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.
But mine was a little different, you see.
To kill with no pain.
And I need you, yeah.
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
And each one I've never seen again.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
Where people carried signs around saying "Ban the bums".
Everybody got to move somewhere.
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
I got my dark sunglasses, I got for good luck my black tooth.
Baby, two feet from the well.
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
Carry for you deep down inside.
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Said, "Ms. Mouse, be you within?" Uh-huh.
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
Mutiny from stern to bow.
That he not busy being born is a-busy dying.
My love, she speaks softly.
The whole world is my throne.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
Baby, I'm under your spell.
You know the song in my heart.
Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop.
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.
Oh, use your hands and legs, it won't ruin you.
Stone you and they'll be back again.
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
He traveled a-with a gun in every hand.
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.
And I–I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
But my heart is telling me I love you still.
Oh, her darling love she found.
When it's you who must keep it satisfied.
Street band playing "Nearer My God to Thee".
And make promises by the hours.
And crime don't have a face.
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
When I go to my grave, my head will be high.
I've heard you say many times that you're better than no one and no one is better than you.
So long, honey babe.
If you won't come out your window.
They've been talking about a war now for a-many long years.
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
And they made a killer outta him is what they did.

I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
When out comes a farmer – he musta thought that I was nuts.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants, which nobody really wanted to touch.
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity.
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
You say you're assuming that you're kind of a-hurting, but you know sometimes you lie.
It's alright, ma, I can make it.
Of your useless and pointless knowledge.
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat.
You know, he keeps on saying everything twice to me.
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.
Well, the hobo got to hide, but he came to me naturally.
You just build it cheaper someplace else.
He's a weird monkey, very funky.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Startles your ears to hear somebody thinks that they really have found you.
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round.
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me.
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display.
I'm just average, common too.
Know not what the years may hold.
I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
Couldn't see, I didn't know where I was, I was bald.
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
Look a-the other way.
You're drifting too far from shore.
I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
I shall be released.
'Cause the times, they are a-changing.
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
They complained in the East – they are paying too high.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
You're my baby.
And you––you took me in, you loved me then, you never wasted time.
As the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from Black Diamond Bay.
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel.
And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
But you're gonna serve somebody.
Figuring a way to get back home.
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
All the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem.
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.
To understand, you know too soon there's no sense in trying.
But you were tangled up in blue.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
Seven more days and all that will be gone.
To know which way the wind blows.
Just you coming and spilling juice over me.
As someone who has had you on his mind.
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.
Delia's dear mother took a trip out West.
And your fall-by-the-sword love affair with Errol Flynn.

If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be.
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
Well, it can't be no guitar player, it must be convent bells.
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.
They say "Sing!" while you slave and I just get bored.
Oh, I awoke in anger, so alone and terrified.
Well, I'm lost somewhere, I must've made a few bad turns.
I just can't be happy, love, unless you're happy too.
You're bound to fall." You thought they were all kidding you.
If I had my way, I'd sell it right back.
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.
Albert said, "I'm leaving you, won't be gone for long.
I cannot move, my fingers, they're all even in a knot.
And there's no use in trying to deal with the dying, though I cannot explain that in lines.
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.
There was dust on the man in the long, black coat.
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.
Rita said "Come back!" and he started to load.
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features.
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.
And someday maybe – who knows, baby? – I'll come and be crying to you.
See that my grave is kept clean.
Make a living by a-putting on airs.
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road.
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.
And, every time that he'd get full, he was spoiling for a fight.
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.
His mama sure was proud of him.
That can win what's never been won.
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
You can have the truth, but you got to choose it.
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
Said, "Ms. Mousey, will you marry me?" Uh-huh.
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two.
His voice was low with pain.
Toiling in the danger, in the morals of despair.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow.
O'er the road we're bound to go.
Heart-fixer, mind-regulator, true to the end.
All the young men with the young women looking so good.
Honey, just allow me one more chance, I'll do anything for you.
The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
I fought it full without regret or shame.
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.
Went into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
It was all over by a quarter past.
You ain't worth the blood that runs in your veins.
And, if you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.
Even though Rita moved away and got a job at a motel.
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.
Under the midnight moon.
I knew that very instant she meant to do me harm.
He left her penniless in a state of regret – it was time to bust outta the cage.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
I have heard rumors all over town.
Duality, mortality.
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear.
Feel further away than ever before.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
Running out the clock, time standing still.
Nothing can hold you down, nothing that you lack.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of her farewell kiss to me.
"Fried mosquito in a black-eyed pea." Uh-huh.
Is to say I've been hitting some hard traveling too.
Well, I'm walking down the road with my head in my hand.
That he'll live by the rules that the world makes for him.
If it's you my lifelines trace.
And, every time I pass that way, I always hear my name.
Bring that bottle over here.
The cavalries charged, then the Indians died.
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then.
You're invisible, you've got no secrets to conceal.
But all his sexless patients, they are trying to blow it up.
Leave no stone unturned.
To do anything they wish to do, but die.
And she steals your voice and leaves you screaming at the moon.
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row.
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.
Please let me ride you home.
When she did, she could not believe her eyes.
Your son is coming back from the war.
The bombs were meant for him, he was supposed to feel bad.
But power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is.
And that the land that I live in has God on its side.
But you're never sure why you're here.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.
They let me go right away – they were very paranoid.
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.
For his tongue, it could not speak, but only flatter.
So, I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip.
I'm everybody's brother and son.
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
She knows that she's not afraid to look at her.
Well, I'll sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more.
And I covered her up and then thought I'll go look through her drawer.
She made well sure her neighbors understood.
Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
Can't see over to the other side.
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
Don't even have anything for myself anymore.
In the north end of town my own children're grown.
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
A hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform.
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.
I saw three ships sailing, they were all heading my way.
I'm going where I never been before.
They both rode off together.
Chain you down or be your clown.
Just trying to find my little all and all.
The National Guard stands around his door.
And the wind blows high above the tree.
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
There's seven breezes blowing all around the cabin door.
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes don't look into mine.
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
Papa gone mad, mama, she's feeling sad.
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
I'm sailing away in the morning.
You say I let you down, you know it's not like that.
And the pearls are from Japan.
By the man who invented iron and disappeared so mysteriously.
The last radio is playing.
That's a lot of territory indeed.
Right now I'm having trouble.
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.
Lost time is not found again.
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
Honey, baby.
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images, and distorted facts.
But with the country to where you're going.
I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
Until my dying-day.
That he not busy being born is busy dying.
Jump into the wagon, love, throw your panties overboard.
She once was a true love of mine.
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down.
Said it was a bad dream.
Well, I've been looking all over for a girl like you.
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.
See like me or be like me.
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat.
Ain't no use to talk to me.
That I really did try to get close to you.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.
You may not see me tomorrow.
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
And Louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it.
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity.
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood.
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.
Someone's watching over you.
From inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Oh, her true love e'er to be.
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, I forgot.
I'm in love with my second cousin, I tell myself I could be happy forever with her.
As the step was his pillow, the street was his bed.
It's bad out there, high water everywhere.
I'll only let you down.
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth.
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
Oh, me, I busted out – don't even ask me how.
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.
I took some comfort there.
When you made everybody pay.
I'm younger than that now.
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.
Just remind me to show you the scars.
Hope you're ready.
Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
I shot my Albert dead and now I'm going to hell.
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
I came here to fulfill our last promise and hoped to give you a surprise.
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.
But I can't help falling in love with you.
You put your eyes in your pockets and your nose into the ground.
I can tell you are torn between staying and returning back to the South.
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Ain't gonna hang no picture, ain't gonna hang no picture-frame.
Everybody must get stoned.
Don't know how it looked to other people, I never slept with her even once.
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
He said, "I guess you're tired." He said it kinda sly.
Lord, I'm a-going where I never been before.
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.
But he's badly-built and he walks on stilts – watch out he don't fall on you.
Ain't no loving since she been gone.
Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
Visions of your smoking tone shoot through my head and are making me see stars.
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.
Deep down inside, you know, you know – need a whole new beginning.
Well, Judas, he just winked and said, "Alright, I'll leave you here.
But the joke was on me, there was nobody even there to bluff.
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
Where teardrops fall.
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
Till one day all of his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.
Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work.
Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
And it seems like I want to travel on.
Anita Ekberg, Sophia Loren.
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
Wiggle till it bites, wiggle till it cuts.
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby.
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts.
Rode slowly back again.
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold.
Well, it's one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train.
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
Please quit your low-down ways.
Well, my back's been to the wall so long it seem like it's stuck.
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
Pull out your six-shooter and rob every bank you can see.
A-move a-lightly on the ground.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down and pawn it, babe.
Headed out for the western skies.
Take it on in in a <i>bowl-cup</i>.
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
And now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it.
I'd ask him what the matter was, but I know that he don't talk.
And, in a matter of minutes, on bail was out walking.
Just what you're gonna say when you get home.
Who always was too proud to beg.
You came in like a wind, like Errol Flynn, you changed my life.
Then, she says, "You don't read women authors, do you?" At least that's what I think I hear her say.
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.
And puts her hands in her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
And you never ask questions when God's on your side.
"Well, I seen your Cadillac window up-town.
Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.
Silver hair, ragged shirt, and baggy pants, that old soft shoe.
With a sword and a pistol by his side, uh-huh.
Of when the red iron ore pits run aplenty.
My love, she laughs like the flowers.
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
She went with the man in the long, black coat.
My mind is breaking.
That I made it so easy for you to follow me.
You'll never see me frown.
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night café.
I threw it all away.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
In the pale moonlight.
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
There he still sits on top of the hill.
Well, I walk on pins and needles, I hope my tongue don't slip.
You're very well-read, it's well-known.
And my best friend, the doctor, he won't even tell me what it is that I've gots.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey.
What was it you wanted? Tell me again, so I'll know.
And it's hard times, from the country, living down in New York town.
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.
You can make it too.
I scarcely feel the glow.
They got him on conspiracy – they were never sure who with.
"Oh, well," I said, "it's a pretty big ship.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.
Until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
And don't criticize what you can't understand.
Lady-killers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind.
Shotgun fired and away I ran.
While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself.
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave.
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
When I was down, you just stood there grinning.
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
We died and were reborn and then mysteriously saved.
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.
'Twas a-then that I knew what he had on his mind.
And if I don't make it, you know my baby will.
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him.
Watch the parking meters.
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
Then in comes his daughter, whose name was Rita.
Cops a-coming, me a-running.
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
From the little Minnesota town.
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there.
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
She said she would always stay.
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
"Way down yonder in the hollow tree." Uh-huh.
She saw her Albert there a-loving up Alice Fry.
Better get away from Oxford Town.
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks, and left them for dead in the morning.
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to.
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
Got a shock from my feet that hit my brain.
I got a woman in Jackson – oh, I ain't gonna say her name.
Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
She saw her father's body broken.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.
And the people that confronted him were many.
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me.
The old man then rolled off the curb.
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust.
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand.
She said that all the railroad men just drink up your blood like wine.
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
See the groom still waiting at the altar.
I didn't know what I was a-gonna do.
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.
But I made up my mind that I had to get on.
But I ain't the judge, you don't have to be nice to me.
And to all the good people that traveled with you.
And they're breaking down the distance between a-right and wrong.
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon.
The walls collide, Mona cries.
He wanted money up front, he said he'd been abused by dignity.
Four by four they turn it some more.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine.
Ooh, pressing on to the higher calling of my Lord.
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.
In the brightness of my day.
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know.
To make me think I'm wrong.
And it is time for me to slide.
'Bout the shape that he's in.
I said, "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
I never seen him quarrel with my mother even once, things come alive or they fall flat.
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.
I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough.
You were my first love and you will be my last.
It's inconceivable it could happen to you.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
All clean-shaven, all coming in from the cold.
Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold.
Don't ask me nothing about nothing – I just might tell you the truth.
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
Come on out, the dark is just beginning.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.
If you just let me follow you down.
I been worrying about you, baby.
I could offer you a warm embrace to make you feel my love.
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
Walking a road other men have gone down.
I'm locked in tight, I'm outta range.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.
My baby stole my heart from me.
Means another poor boy is underground.
Well, the long winter's wait from the window I watched.
Whoever it is, I wish they'd cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess.
Delia's in the graveyard, she might never, never get up.
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift.
She was the only daughter of the engineer.
The night will soon be gone.
Mama, you been on my mind.
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
Down along my restless palms.
Or maybe I do, but I'm just really not sure.
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
Your old road's rapidly aging.
Or remember the sounds of my own name.
All except inside the gates of Eden.
Till she started peeling off her onion gook.
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
It's all just a dream, babe, a vacuum, a scheme, babe, that sucks you into feeling like this.
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Standing at my window, wishing me goodnight.
You can't find no salvation, have no expectations any time, any place, anywhere.
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
My beautiful comrade from the north.
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
I'm wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean.
You don't have to be afraid.
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared.
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.
About having to scrounge your next meal.
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.
I'm down on my knees and I ain't got a dime.
All of your [incomprehensible] and let's talk about your soul.
I'm T-boned and punctured, I've been known to be calm.
Throw my suitcase out there too.
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you feel my love.
Valentines can't buy her.
Then they bury him with stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
I know you always say that you agree.
She's a-drinking down her troubles over courting some other man.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.
Folks lose their possessions, the folks are leaving town.
We're all boxed in, nowhere to escape.
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.
Everything passes, everything changes. Just do what you think you should do.
And accept it all bravely with God on my side.
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.
Remember me to one who lives there.
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.
And I––I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, now don't ask for mine.
So, darling, I'm counting on you.
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.
The man you were loving could never get clean.
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is a-history.
I crossed that river just to be where you are.
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.
And disregards the rest.
And I've never been too impressed.
In bed with nobody, under no one's command.
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed.
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Man gave names to all the animals in the beginning, a long time ago.
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
I need a woman that's mine alone.
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel .44.
Your loyalty is not to me, but to the stars above.
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.
With an iron chain around his neck.
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
Police at your back.
They're all gonna take on down by the <i>bounded</i> bank.
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here.
The way you walk and the way you talk is the way it oughtta be.
I can't fire them anymore.
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.
For your times, they are a-changing.
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
Oh, quickly, heal his wounds.
Joking and talking about the world outside.
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.
And now you're gonna have to get used to it.
So interchangeable, so delightful to see.
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune.
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.
Timber, two foot six across, burns with the bark still on.
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
He bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity.
There's no words that need to be said.
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
"We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
He never did plan to walk the high wire.
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.
From silver and gold, from what man cannot hold, you changed my life.
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side.
That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
Mama, you're just on my mind.
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Ten by ten they drank it again.
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
He was going down slow, just barely staying alive.
Danced a jig with the bumbly bee, uh-huh.
You just to give away your check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
But the fighter still remains.
I couldn't find any.
You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Lights flicker from the opposite loft.
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
Well, I'm just thumping.
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerking.
And, if whiskey don't kill me, then, I don't know what will.
No contract he signed was worth what was it written on.
Lincoln and Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I'm gonna go there when I feel good enough to go.
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
Do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in.
She's in some foreign land.
You can say I didn't give to you.
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.
To anything I might've tried.
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
Step lightly on the ground.
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.
This silence of tongues, it was building.
So I best be on my way in the early morning rain.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you.
A pay-phone was ringing, it just about blew my mind.
Heading for the gates of Eden.
That even Jesus would never forgive what you do.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.
Tell me.
Split up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing it was best.
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerousl,.
If not for you.
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back.
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.
My eyes were closed, I was half asleep.
Sometimes I wonder to just––what it's all coming to.
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl – and me – oh, God! – I'm a one.
But I'm just as happy as you, baby, I just can't say it so well.
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core, he's a coward, and he steals.
Yes, you do, you know you do.
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting.
Told the first father that things weren't right.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
Close your eyes, close the door.
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
And famines and earthquakes and train-wrecks and tearing down of the wall.
I'd lie in my bed once again.
Saying wants company.
You tamed the lion in my cage, but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Where she was born on midsummer's eve near the tower.
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty.
Won't you come with me, baby? I'll take you where you wanna go.
Long distance operator, I believe I'm strangling in this telephone wire.
He stole my baby and he wanted to steal me.
Turned on my record player.
Cannot hold you to its heat.
With a worn heart, whose better days are over.
Putting her in a wheel-barrow and wheeling her down the street.
And try to avoid the scandals.
Someone said that Dignity was the first to leave.
Is the saving grace that's over me.
What you'll say when you get home.
Your cracked country-lips I still wish to kiss as to be by the strength of your skin.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
Tangled up in blue.
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way.
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
Inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more.
Where I can watch her waltz for free 'neath her Panamanian moon.
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Going through all these things twice.
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another name.
Well, the Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly.
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat.
I got nothing to go back to now.
And say you'll always let it be me.
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died.
Most of the time.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, all the rest of them rebel rivers.
Some things in life, it just gets too late to learn.
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.
And you dare not change them one night for you know, if you do, you'll be flogged in the morning.
Won't fall upon 'em naturally, life sometimes must get lonely.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness.
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
But my heart's just not in it, I might as well pass right on by.
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
People'd ask about you, I didn't tell 'em everything I knew.
Each one wishing for what the other has got.
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.
As the sun went down and the music did play on Black Diamond Bay.
A few hard cases I will recall, though they all were brave and true.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.
I gave you all of what I could provide.
Go away from my door and my window too, right now.
And everything that she ever planned just a-had to be postponed.
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town.
To anything I mighta tried.
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.
It didn't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects.
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
Maybe we just better call off the picnic.
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
She also keeps the cards that read "Have Mercy on His Soul".
If I ride back again.
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss.
A foreign sound to your ear.
Looking for the places only they would know.
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs.
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train.
Yet she's true like ice, like fire.
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.
They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.
I offered her my hand, she took me by the arm.
Go to him now, he calls you and you can't refuse.
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
Hollow man looking in a cotton-field for dignity.
The wind knocks my window, the room, it is wet.
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
Writes me letters, and sends me checks.
And wait for succeeding kings.
Pull him down in a county hook, my man.
About an old man that never done wrong.
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.
But we're heading for a wall of stone.
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.
From the city of seven hills, near the place of the cross.
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
I'd rather have drowned in misery than gone to New South Wales.
I got a real gal I'm loving, Lord, I'll love her till I'm dead.
Your daddy walks in wearing a Napoleon Bonaparte mask.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.
Then he said, "Yes, I think it can be easily done.
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm.
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
She gave her heart to the man in the long, black coat.
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
Sacrifice was the code of the road.
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Just a one kind favor I ask of you: allow me just one more chance.
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see, but he just cannot touch.
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could.
Your pawnbroker roared and also so did the landlord.
I'm gon' to teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud.
I don't wanna believe them, all I want is your word.
I got nothing left to burn.
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.
When I took up his offer, I must've been mad.
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh.
Tell me that it isn't true.
It only brings me sorrow.
I'm not the one you need.
So I'm going, I'm just going, I'm gone.
The cavalries charged, the Indians died.
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.
Who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me.
I never saw the man again.
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat, she said, "Take it off the shelf.
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole down upon your knees.
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
Madams light the candles.
It's alright, ma, I'm only sighing.
Oh, you got to trust yourself.
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
And there's no time to think.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.
Lord, protect my child.
Speaking to some French girl, who says she knows me well.
You can say I was on anything but a roll.
I gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
You gonna have to serve somebody.
Hear me singing through these tears.
I never know what the poor girl's gonna do to me next.
And that smile's so hard to resist.
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.
And I want you to be that woman.
You were always so close and still within reach.
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee with a voice as cold as ice.
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away from Black Diamond Bay.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid.
Reality has always had too many heads.
And time is running backwards and so is the bride.
And I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe.
Six by six they were playing with tricks.
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Dropping a barbell, he point to the sky.
I just walk and watch you talk with your memory on my mind.
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona-land.
Gone as the season she's taken.
All the things that I'm saying and many times more.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head.
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.
You only got ten.
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
He ain't-a got no name.
I was mighty, mighty tired. I had come a long, long way.
Is just looking for a needle that's lost in the sand.
Telling me he loves all kinds of people.
She can take the dark out of the nighttime and paint the daytime black.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
Out to the country club and the golf course.
I hate myself for loving you and I'm glad the curtain fell.
Father of love and father of rain.
And I need you, yeah, you, ah, I need you.
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.
The stars above the barren trees was his only audience.
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech.
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
What look good in the day at night is another thing.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
A man who swears he's not to blame.
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.
Baby, baby.
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.
You'd better do something quick, she's your lover now.
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep.
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.
Is gonna be against the law.
On anyone that lives in a vault.
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up and, tears or not, it's too much to ask.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.
Put me outta doors.
Girls like birds fly away.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
I spied an old hobo, in the doorway he lay.
Everything is broken.
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.
I can't even remember El Paso, a-honey.
I know you're sorry, I'm sorry too.
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
Well, I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
You looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me.
Wasn't any difference to me.
And one day he came passing by.
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat.
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work.
In the days of old, in the days of gold, in the days of '49.
Wouldn't know the difference between a real blonde and a fake.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Swallowed the mouse and ate up the rat, uh-huh.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed.
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away – we're gonna forget it.
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover.
Heart of mine.
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
We can start it all over, get it back on the track.
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.
But, like Louise always says, "You can't look at much, can you, man?" as she herself prepares for him.
My pockets are loaded and I'm spending every dime.
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
And guarded them as they fell.
Darling, I'm a-counting on you.
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
Orders from the D.A.
I'm trying to get closer, but I'm still a million miles from you.
But my soulful mama, you know, she keeps me hid.
The bridge at midnight trembles.
"Well, saddle for me my coal-black stud, he's speedier than the gray.
No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
When someone disappears, you never even know.
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Lay your hand upon my head.
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Writing "Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" for you.
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
Last radio is playing.
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
In every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand.
I'll be your baby tonight.
I'm just like him, the same as you.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
How across the sea from England I was condemned to sail.
You can't win with a losing hand.
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy.
I seen a man.
I wouldn't marry the president." Uh-huh.
At the head of the Chamber of Commerce.
How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours.
To buy his niece a wedding gown, uh-huh.
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
Nobody stops to ask why.
And you'll die in your footsteps before you go down under the ground.
If you throw it all away.
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon.
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay Little Maggie's wine.
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.
Things are breaking up out there, high water everywhere.
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
When a can of black paint did fell on my head.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
Now I believe what the Bible told.
Down to New Orleans.
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.
No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on.
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be.
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land.
I got nothing but affection for all those who've sailed with me.
You either got faith or you got unbelief and there ain't no neutral ground.
I know the kinds of things you like.
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.
With the heat rising in my eyes.
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
So many dead-ends, and I'm at the edge of the lake.
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.
Say you got some other––other kind of lover and, yes, I believe you do.
I swear it's bound to get me killed.
And time is beginning to crawl.
Walk like a duck, and smell like a skunk.
Tyranny, hypocrisy.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
When there was blood on the moon, in the cotton belt.
For she once was a true love of mine.
And a license to kill him given out to every maniac.
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
And the ancient, empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree.
That I left in the French Quarter.
Mama, you are on my mind.
I'll flip the channel to number four.
You'll do as much for me.
I think this time we should escape.
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom.
His enemies say he's on their land.
The streets of heaven are lined with gold.
I just don't think that I could handle it.
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.
Trying to read a letter to me somebody wrote about dignity.
Wiggle on your hands and knees.
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Even the butler, he's got something to prove.
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks.
They found him dead in the street one day.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Just what this song is all about.
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream-twister.
Crumble into one another.
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning.
She gone with the man in the long, black coat.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughed and slapped his leg a step.
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in.
Looking for them rounders looking out for me.
I don't know.
Billy, and you're going all alone.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
I always liked San Francisco, I was there for a party once.
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're tugging at your sleeve.
When they didn't wanna know or see.
To win friends and influence his uncle.
"How are you?" he said to me, I said it back to him.
If you were just here by my side to show me how.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.
The rats have got your flour, bad blood, it got your mare.
I'd be lost if not for you.
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss.
Now, each of us has his own special gift and you know this was meant to be true.
And that seven deaths shall never kill him.
Hoof-beats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars.
I'm just going, I'm going, I'm gone.
The same as my father before him.
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain.
Wiggle like a big, fat snake.
You want a watered-down love.
Your eyes fix on the shotgun that you're holding in your hand.
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.
The could-be dream lover of my lifetime.
"Come and go with me, my pretty, little miss, come and go with me, my honey.
And she had left him to die in there.
On the caboose of the train.
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks.
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
And, after finding that I'd forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
I used to care, but things have changed.
I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Never had to be faithful, I never wanted you to grieve.
And I need you, ah.
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
I can hear that whistle blowing.
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
She passed the door where the Greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a-"Do Not Disturb".
And I never did plan to go anyway to Black Diamond Bay.
If it's information you want, you can get it from the police.
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose.
If you want anymore, you can sing it yourself, uh-huh.
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough.
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings.
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp.
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.
I can't a-hear you anymore.
Or inspect you or reject you.
Meantime, life outside goes on all around you.
But the mountains of the past.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
I got a bird that sings.
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.
Sound like it's on a final run.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.
An innocent man in a living hell.
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
I find it so difficult to leave.
Just like the time before and the time before that.
Tomorrow keeps turning around.
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no release.
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.
And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move.
Billy, you been running for so long.
Now, the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost.
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
Yeah! going to have some fun.
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, pretending that you're so smart.
Feel like talking to somebody, but I just don't know who.
Oh, convey herself away.
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way.
Or I'm bound to die trying.
Ain't gonna hang no picture or hang no picture-frame.
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.
While evening slips away.
That night, the boss came home inquiring about his lady.
'Steada burning every bridge I crossed.

Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
To tie up the time most forcefully.
Now, the bricks lay on Grand Street, where the neon madmen climb.
The only thing I could do was be me and get on that train and ride.
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
Tree trunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon.
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet outta sight.
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Just remember that death is not the end.
There's a man going 'round calling names.
You've been fooled into thinking that the finishing end is at hand.
You say you told me that you wanna hold me, but you know you're not that strong.

I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn.
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
What some people are gonna do for money.
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
As the present now will later be past.
I hope I'm ready.
For there's a slow––said there's a slow, slow train coming.
Greenwich Village.
I know they're not what they seem.
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight.
Yes, tell me.
So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.

"Rip down all hate!" I screamed.
That, if God is on our side, He'll stop the next war.
Must be and that is all.
Tell her her baby's on the line.
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land.
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.

Up and down the lonesome town.

For there's a slow – there's a slow, slow train coming.
And the Santa Fe.
I followed the winding stream.
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
Even joined a union, paid my dues.
Is, baby, be friends with you.
"There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
The whole night through.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch.
But I would never do you wrong.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me, but you know sometimes you lie.
Any day now, oh, any day now, I shall be released.
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
But they made a killer outta him is what they did.
The First World War, boys, it came and it went.
But the town has no need to be nervous.
You told yourself a lie, that's alright, mama, I told myself one too.
With a crashing, but meaningless blow.
You say, "Impossible!" as he hand you a--a bone.
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knee.
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse.
For the saving grace that's over me.
When you go your way and I go mine.
I'm short on gas, my motor's starting to stall.
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.
She's a hypnotist collector, you are a walking antique.
To marry John Thomas, a miner.
He's eating bagels. He's eating pizza. He's eating chitlins.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.
Oh, hard times, come again no more.
Come on, baby...
Either one, I don't care." High water everywhere.
Take the rag away from your face! Now ain't the time for your tears.
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.
Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
Tried to create a next world war.
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
Ring them bells so the world will know that-a God is one.
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
We were the wrong side.
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.
To which a scoundrel clings.
Now they say it's the land of money.
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
It can't be this way everywhere.
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split.
I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
Wiggle till the moon sees you.
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
You came down the line, gave me a new mind, you changed my life.
You're a big girl now.
Dodging lions and wasting time.
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
Your wife's screams're stabbing you like the dirty, driving rain.
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
Handing out free tickets to the wedding of his son.
And it makes me feel so sorry.
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
Just like you've always smiled before.
I don't know any more than this.
In my Cadillac.
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild-goose chase.
But you'd better take your diamond ring down, now, you'd better pawn it, babe.
Blowing through another no-good town.
Friends with you.
Unless they're from another world.
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.
And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
And no time to think.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
You just want to be on the side that's winning.
He grabbed his pants for a better stance, oh, he jumped so high and clicked up his heels.
Your voice was all that I heard.
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
I'm painting the town, making my last go-round.
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
That, if God's on our side, He'll stop the next war.
I didn't go to sleep last night.
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues.
Now you don't talk so loud.
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Yes, march me away to the station, I'm off to some far, distant land.
And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.
Don't get up, gentlemen, I'm only passing through.
Kick your shoes off, do not fear.
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.
I got a woman in Jackson – I ain't gonna say her name.
So I beg you: let it be me.
Fear to bring children into the world.
His dog up and died, he up and died, and after twenty years he still grieves.
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head and bid them take that as fair warning.
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face.
And ye shall be a-changed.
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
I'd like to know.
"And light on my right knee.
Your hurts used to be so nameless and your tears used to be so few.
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
And shot it fulla holes.
That I remember in my true love's eyes.
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to me.
To the sin of love's false security.
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt, you can give but you cannot receive.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you.
Baby, let me follow you down.
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires.
Well, it's sundown on the union and what's made in the USA.
I only saw what they let me see.
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale.
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
Into the valley of dry-bone dreams.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
She's a brown-skin woman, but I–I love her just the same.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlight stream.
Who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death.
My children will go as soon as they grow.
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.
I step outside back to the busy street, but nobody's going anywhere.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to keep it.
"Arise! Arise!" he cried so loud with a voice without restraint.
Or pick it up after he throws it.
One of the men who held it high was the Indian, Ira Hayes.
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
Get your mind off wintertime, you ain't going nowhere.
Some place so high above the wall.
He's the neighborhood bully.
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
I can't help it much if this train gets lost.
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom.
I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.
Well, my heart's in the Highlands, I can only get there one step at a time.
Through the back alleys, through the blinds, another one of them endless days.
I did not do it knowingly.
I can bite like a turkey, I can slam like a drake.
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, taking me down to hell.
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Till the break of day let me see you make him smile.
Chain you down or bring you down.
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down.
Your empty pockets tell you that you ain't got no friend.
Wiggle, you can raise the dead.
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.
Sorry, that's a-nothing you would need to know.
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border.
In hunger and need you made my heart bleed, you changed my life.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead.
Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul.
"Oh, yes, he is my friend," said Frankie Lee in fright.
Sara, oh, Sara, don't ever leave me, don't ever go.
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train.
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
In the dark land of the sun.
Billy, and you're playing all alone.
That he needs you to test his inventions.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
But you said you knew and I took your word.
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
But it's alright, ma, it's life and life only.
And don't go mistaking paradise for that home across the road.
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
Just crying out that he was framed.
You're invisible, you got no secrets to conceal.
Well, he threw a Reader's Digest at my head and I did run.
Now they wanna grow it on the moon and eat it raw.
But he cursed me when I proved to him. Then I whispered and said, "Not even you can hide.
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
Started to hug and kiss him, but there was no bringing him back.
Is it something important? Maybe not.
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
You got it, baby.
Yeah, I tell myself something's coming, but it never does.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.
The fortune-telling lady has even taken all her things inside.
If'n you don't know by now.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.
To reach of your rattling drums.
Talking to myself in a monologue.
I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back.
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.
'Cause I'd already promised that I'd milk his cows.
So quickly into autumn.
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded from the corners of her mouth.
You're very-well read, it's well-known.
When I'm alone with you.
Whatever you wanted slipped out of my mind.
When your foot of pride come down, ain't no going back.
The way you walk and the way you talk, I swear, it would make me sing.
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
With guns in their hands and God on their side.
I froze right to the bone.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy a thrill.
"I've got to talk to someone quick!" But the Greek said, "Go away!", and he kicked the chair to the floor.
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
But your love just hasn't proved true.
That we could sit simply in that room again.
Flows out of their bodies and is buried in the mud.
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day.
I'll remember you.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care.
All the friends I ever had are gone.
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
I got a woman who works herself blind.
She had chrome-brown eyes that I won't forget as long as she's gone.
Got ice water in my veins.
It runs both cold and deep.
Went into the land of the midnight sun.
Obscenity – who really cares? – propaganda all is phony.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
Your old road is rapidly aging.
And I'll rock you too.
That old ship was a-going down.
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.
But he sure left here in style.
Sweet lady.
I know you're long gone, I guess it must be up to me.
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
People can't wait, they're gathered around.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
Yes, I received your letter yesterday about the time the door-knob broke.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Honey, come and see about me.
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.
Hmm, tell me.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone.
Someone to open each and every door.
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them that's insane.
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Seven shots ring out like the ocean's pounding roar.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
And there wasn't any difference to me.
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair.
Looking for them Reds everywhere.
"And stay all night with me.
I've only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume.
Into the ditch of what each one means.
Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon, but we're gonna let it. You won't regret it.
It's unbelievable it would get this far.
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole darn town.
Just what he was talking about.
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
When it comes to scratching for my meat.
Than people who are most content.
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.
"I've come to win some money," Gambling Willie says.
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets fly.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
You're my honey.
Willie's cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights.
By a guy making thirty cents a day.
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in his pants.
And his mother had to turn her face away.
I wish someone'd come and push back the clock for me.
I don't blame him too much, though. He didn't know me.
By the jealousy of others around her.
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss.
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn.
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
Come on, honey.
Someone musta told 'em that I was doing fine.
My love winks, she does not bother.
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
People bending broken rules.
I'm gonna look at you till my eyes go blind.
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
I went back in the house and mama met me and then I shut all the doors.
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
It doesn't matter inside the gates of Eden.
It's just escaping on the run, and but for the sky there are no fences facing.
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
The words to say "I'm sorry" I haven't found yet.
The lonesome sparrow sings.
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
So many people I never saw in my life.
All inside the walls, the walls of Red Wing.
And left me here facing the wall.
The bottom of the barrel is too.
Won't let go and I can't let go.
Somebody's got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me.
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
His room was dark and crowded, lights were low and dim.
She put down in writing what was in her mind.
Or define you or confine you.
For the times, they–they are a-changing.
Neighborhood bully.
By and by on you I'm casting my eye.
With his lady by his side he took a stand.
Shoot a few holes, blow their minds.
Never been so easy or so slow.
As I landed on the psychiatric couch.
Either one of us could do what we do best.
I need a shot of love.
Some speak of the future.
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
It seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a Panama hat and a pair of old Greek shoes.
The dogs were barking, the neighbor passed, mama, of course she said hi.
And all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind.
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long.
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees.
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay.
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me.
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.
You'll know the love that I had for you was never my own.
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.
It's that million dollar bash.
She murdered mortal he.
Some place so high above this wall.
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
Everything inside is made of stone.
He was never known to make a foolish move.
I dreamed I saw Saint Augustine, alive with fiery breath.
It's nothing – it's something I learned over in England.
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row.
She doesn't have to say she's faithful.
"Well met, well met," cried she.
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten Island Ferry.
They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls.
But I never yet found Fennario.
And I've a-never been too impressed.
It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.
But I swear I love you, yes, I do.
Honey, I want you.
We have no desire strange places to see although that your offers are charming.
She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where everyone walked.
Six by six...
Wondering who turned the lights on us.
Mortality, reality.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
When he's got a hungry mouth to feed.
It looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.
And I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
"Oh, stop that cursed jury!" cried the attendant and the nurse.
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing.
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Join the army if you fail.
Her Jamaican rum and, when she did come, I asked her for some.
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
When all the people passed, she saw her son at last.
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm.
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see.
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
What was it you wanted? You can tell me, I'm back.
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook.
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
Gather there together, ain't room for no more.
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.
Lay dead beside him there.
Have a-fallen from her curls.
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went.
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
Whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass.
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
Saying, "Hey, I've been having the same old dreams.
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Cassius Clay, you'd better run.
To live it you had to explode.
But I'm already there in my mind and that's good enough for now.
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had.
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Saviors are fast asleep, wait for you.
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain't my property.
I didn't realize how young you were.
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet.
Don't know how much time I got, don't know how long I'll live.
Don't put your hope in ungodly men or be a slave to what somebody else believes.
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Turn you into anything that they want you to be.
The sooner you can leave.
And now you're better––you're gonna have to get used to it.
And a little wee drummer intending to camp for a day being pleasant and charming.
It's President Kennedy calling me up.
I finally got a job in New York town.
But, mama, you been on my mind.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
While my conscience explodes.
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
Your days are numbered, so are mine.
Judge says to the High Sheriff, "I want him dead or alive.
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
He bought your city on a one-way track.
I can't see through it anymore.
Take me as I am or let me go.
I had something to protect.
That big, old boat started to sink.
And gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum.
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend.
Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
Is tearing up your mind.
But I will always be emotionally yours.
Quicker than anyone I knew.
That hype you and type you and making you feel that you gotta be just like them.
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.
Let us hope they've found mercy in their bone-filled graves.
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Ever since I seen you there.
He must be running for office, got no time to lose.
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
You're a big girl all the way.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere, we'll just have to see how it goes.
Rolls me over, and kicks me out of bed.
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.
Old, young, age don't carry weight, it doesn't matter in the end.
Then said, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done.
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me.
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation Row.
Well, I took me a woman late last night.
All inside the grounds of the walls of Red Wing.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed.
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain.
But rather get you down in the hole that he's in.
At the end of the trail.
Is when I'm alone with you.
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.
But the post office's been stolen and the mailbox is locked.
What can I say about Claudette? Ain't seen her since January.
Trust yourself.
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise.
Life don't mean a thing.
You have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Oh, his darling girl behind.
Puts bubblegum in my food.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.
Blowing like my woman's on board.
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet.
I'd do it, but I–I just can't remember how.
Everybody wants to make a long distance call, but, you know, they're just gonna have to wait.
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
And a-say you'll always let it be me.
There were six thousand people there.
She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
Crammed me back into the county jail.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
And then unto eternity.
That something for nothing is everybody's plan.
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.
Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
Of every man who put me here.
In the world you had made they had made you an outcast.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all, I'll gun the floggers down.
To all give a check to tax-deductible charity organizations.
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.
Honey, just allow me one more chance to get along with you.
Drink up your blood like wine.
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.
Ain't going down to Oxford Town.
A dollar when I'm hard up, religion when I die.
Someone I really could care for.
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Time passes slowly and fades away.
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
68, but says she's 24.
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
"Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
They know the secrets of the breeze.
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
"Yes, kind sir, I sit and spin." Uh-huh.
You break your promise all over the place.
But I was raised on the other.
And gives it to me for a song.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
When my memory is not so short.

We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself just who that––if it's them or him that's really insane.
And, when bringing her name up, he speaks of a farewell kiss to me.
She keeps this .410 all loaded with lead.
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.

May you stay forever young.
Went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down.
She got a pretty face and long, white, shiny legs.
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws.
Again she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with the thread.
Perhaps I'll die on that train.
And that failure's no success at all.

And come away with me.
They call, that simple twist of fate.

Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest, they were the best of friends.
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.
I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.

And these visions of Johanna, they've kept me up past the dawn.
We'll bring you up there on a ship.
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.
Behind a man's brain.
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
But the sun goes around the heavens and another day just drives on through.
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
They don't make nothing here no more.
I'm counting on you, love, to give me a break.
Captain Arab, he started writing up some deeds.
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
And get something quick to eat.
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.
What would I do with it anyway? Maybe take it to the pawn shop.
There was no greater love than what I had for you.
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
By the saving grace that's over me.
So I get brown rice, seaweed, and a dirty hot dog.
You must pick up one or the other, neither of them are to be what they claim.

Going back where we come from.
And the sails are spread.
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.
It was you who understood.
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end.
Now, all he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
I'm a-going where I never been before.
And discovered her invisible self.
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used.
I've made shoes for everyone – even you – while I still go barefoot.

I could stay with you forever and never realize the time.
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key.

There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
The place that I started from.
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
But everybody still talks about how badly they were shocked.

Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.
In the night the price was paid.
Now somebody's got to show their hand, time is an enemy.
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.
We may not make it through the night.
You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way.
To Rockefeller Plaza and the Empire State.

When the bottle gets empty, it sure ain't worth a damn.
Said he, "Ms. Mouse, are you within?" Uh-huh.

Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile.
Yes, I've been up all night, baby, leaning on the windowsill.
When I've forgotten all the rest.
She can do the Georgia Crawl, she can walk in the spirit of the Lord.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
Kisses she gave him three.
Nothing standing there, high water everywhere.
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Baby, baby...
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours' time.
She laid out the tablecloth, uh-huh.
You can't walk the streets in a war.
I was shadow-boxing early in the day.
He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.
Nothing but the moon and stars.
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies.
But it grieves my heart, love, to see you trying to be a part of a world that just don't exist.
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
Your babies're crying louder, now, it's pounding on your brain.
I say, "How much you want for that?" I go into the store.
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
Than to see you be another man's darling and to know that you'll never be mine.
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.
And ordered him to do the Dog.
And you say "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone.
'Cause I don't think about it.
It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.
Lord, I ain't going down to no racetrack see no sports car run.
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
I always thought that he was well.

With a .44 smokeless under my head.

He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.
I dreamt I was walking in World War III.
Guess I owe You some kind of apology.
Now you stand with your thief – you're on his parole.
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
Splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger, as quiet as a mouse.
There are frail forms fainting at the door.
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line.
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Well, they sent for the ambulance and one was sent.
Now and forever let it be me.
Ramona, come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
And maybe say hello with just a glance.
They're still talking about that card game on that Jackson Queen.
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Buildings going up to the sky.
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight, ask himself if it's him or them who should be insane.
Then the mailman comes in – even he's gotta take a side.
Wants to get it paid off.
God knows...
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row.
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.
Looks at his hero, the Commander-in-Chief.
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Just the dust of a plague that has left this whole town afraid.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
Ever since we've been apart.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.
And I need you, ah, yeah.
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
Finalize you or advertise you.
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
Or stay all night with thee.
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can if you wanna learn anything.
Like Cain I now behold this chain of events that I must break.
For that's the way I remember her best.
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.
His mama's face broke out into a grin.
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around.
He's not sentimental, don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.
Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kinda pain.
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin, they explain.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Told me of a new day coming across the field.
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
I can't shoot them anymore.
Suffering ridicule, they want me give it all up in disgust.
And he went and did the Cat instead.
Everybody that was hanging out.
The cloak-and-dagger dangles.
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in.
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots, and I was on the street again.
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male.
Good car to drive, after a war.
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
"Get well, get well," said she.
It's just the old American way.
Startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you.
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
Their minds are filled with false ideas, images, and distorted facts.
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
If she wake up now, you know, she'll just a-want me to talk.
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.
Bid farewell forever.
And puts her hands into her back pocket Bette Davis-style.
They tell you "Time is money" as if your life was worth its weight in gold.
Moving with a simple twist of fate.
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends.
Epitome, rigidity.
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.
Till the white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed.
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
You could make me cry if you don't know.
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain't going down.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
You give something up for everything you gain.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Like you never done before.
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Never took much trouble with the process of the law.
As Lady and I look out tonight from Desolation Row.
Bury the rag deep in your face for now's the time for your tears.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey".
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
Sure was a good idea till greed got in the way.
Don't think twice, it's alright.
For Halloween give her a trumpet and for Christmas buy her a drum.
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.
A man named Martin Luther King...
It's hard times, in the country, living down in New York town.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top.
It's done with a flick of the wrist.
That set everybody free.
No martyr is among ye now whom you can call your own.
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.
I don't care what in the world you do.
You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
Somewheres in the distance there's seven new people born.
I'll see you on God's golden shore.
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
Well, I ride on a mail-train, baby, can't buy no thrill.
He made it to Kansas City, Twelfth Street and Vine.
They're making a voyage to the sun.
And she'll only know he's dead.
'Specially when it's nine below zero and three o'clock in the afternoon.
My face you'll never see no more.
Sara, oh, Sara, you must forgive me my unworthiness.
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write.
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon/
There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them:
Howard just pointed off a-with his gun:
And you'll be fine at the end of the line:
Until one day he just appeared with a note in his hand, which read:
Walk with a swagger and he say to the bride:
And, yes, there's something you can send back to me:
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions:
Just to think that it all began in a noneventful morn:
No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
There's just one last favor I'll ask of you:
I'll always a-do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Now, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form:
I tell you something, tell you the facts:
But there's one promise, darling:
I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word:
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore:
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed:
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
"Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
His epitaph plain:
Man is opposed to fair play:
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born:
In Paterson, that's just the way things go:
Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn:
But take a trip before you ship to join the iron gang:
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
Yes, you are, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
I offered up my innocence, got repaid with scorn:
There's a wall between you––what you want and you got to leap it:
And I leaned my head and I give a yell:
Can't help but wonder what's a-happening to my companions:
Yeah, serve somebody:
I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn:
Sister, let me tell you about a vision that I saw:
Yes, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
The whole world's a bottle and life's but a dram:
Yes, indeed, you're gonna have to serve somebody:
Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time:
Oh, man is opposed to fair play:
Oh, the history books tell it, they tell it so well:
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn:
One of these days you're gonna serve somebody:
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
A South politician preaches to the poor white man:
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
A-go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
Serve somebody:
I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse:
The moral of the story is very plain to see:
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm:
There's a man that hates me and he's swift, smooth, and near:
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
But there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than you:
And then, "Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
And he was told but these few words, which opened up his heart:
Till I come into New York town:
Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn:
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you:
Now, everybody's asking why he didn't adjust:
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now:
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Anyone with any sense had already left town;
Outside the crowd was stirring – you could hear it from the door;
All lies and jest;
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time;
Crumble into one another;
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
He would ante up and draw his cards and would you go a hatful blind;
Everybody that was hanging out;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
So many things that we never will undo;
Working for a while in an airplane plant loading cargo onto a truck;
Make promises by the hour;
And to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure;
Nobody can get any sleep – you know, there's someone on everybody's toes;
Working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix;
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
About everybody that was hanging out;
I find complete love;
Some speak of the future;
Had to be held down by big police;

<i>There's this book coming out and they asked me to write, uh, something about Woody, uh, sort of like, "What does Woody Guthrie mean to you in 25 words?"

<i>Play fucking loud!</i>
<i>...if you only just wouldn't clap so hard.</i>
Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
Has the record been breaking? Did the needle just skip?
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
Does he pollute the moon and stars?
What do you think about that, my friend?
How much poison did they inhale?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
Will it come to me after you're gone?
Yes, and you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays. Can't you reach?
My back's to the wall: where can I run?
Who's gonna let it roll?
How does it feel?
Who am I helping? What am I breaking?
Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
In this space I'm taking, in this air I'm inhaling?
Through a hole in the wall to where the long arm of the law cannot reach?
Don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
What can I do for You?
And you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why must you always try to make me over?
How long are we gonna be riding?
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove?
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Who among them, do you think, would employ you?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
"Would you forsake your house and home? Would you forsake your baby?
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?
Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Is that the heat of the beat of your pulse that I feel?
Honey, why not go alone, just you and me?
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?
The love that a stranger might receive?
How many tomorrows have they given away?
And something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
If You find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Don't the sun look good going down over the sea?
What was it you wanted? Are you talking to me?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
But, with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
So I can know if I'm really real?
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Who ever thought they'd ever make that stick?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
Will you please tell that to your friend in the cowboy hat?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
What would life be?
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
Before it's washed to the sea?
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Don't you remember making baby love?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Saying, "Christ, do I gotta be like that?
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler, whose father is deceased?
Why and what's the reason for?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
Señor, Señor, do you know where she's hiding?
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
Something that's crossed over from another century?
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
How weak was the foundation I was standing upon?
What good are you anyway if you can't stand up to some old businessman?
Who you thought you were talking to?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?
"Remember that murder that you––happened in a bar?
Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
My best friend said, "Now, didn't I warn you?
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?
How come you don't send me no regards?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, "Depart from Me"?
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
Why do you want it? Who are you, anyway?
Who killed Davey Moore?
A lover for your life – a-but what more?
Blinds pulled down, what you gonna do?
And what'll you do now, my darling young one?
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
But, something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How deep must I go? Where do I start?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
That's fine, but she's coming on so strange, can't you tell?
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Before it is washed to the sea?
How could they let you go?
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?
You never know what you got till it's gone?
Must everybody bow?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – baby, don't you know?
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Now you stand here, why are your fingers going up my sleeve?
What's wrong with you this time?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining through the trees?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Oh, won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand?
Or for what I didn't do? Or for keeping it hid?
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel?
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Yes, but, you know something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Where did you hide your halo?
How many compared to yesterday?
Something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Yes, and you think something's happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And one deserving of affection?
How'm I supposed to get any riding done?
Because something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And something is happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Did you ever hear that coffin sound?
Why don't you look my way and pump me a few?
Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight?
Is it some kinda game that you're playing with my heart?
How many more can they afford?
He says, "Young man, is your name Brown?
What are you trying to overpower me with, a doctrine or a gun?
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Ever gone broke in a big way?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Gal, where you been so long?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the Double E?
Shining like some diamonds, like some diamonds in the sky?
Does he change the course of rivers?
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of joke?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?
Alberta, what's on your mind?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, do you have to ask?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Before they're allowed to be free?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?
Has anybody seen my love?
Am I still dreaming yet?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?
Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
But who did I see but the one I love?
Baby, what more can I tell?
Yes, because you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
What was it you wanted? Do I have it here in my hand?
If you're so hurt, why then don't you show it?
Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on?
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Let's take a chance – who really cares?
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?
And you willingly surrender to me, but, darling will it last?
What good am I?
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
The scene is so crazy, wasn't it?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there and out there somewhere?
To be stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
Don't the ghost-child look good, baby, sitting on this madman's knees?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Baby, can't you tell?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he's here?
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
'Steada turning her back to my face?
After he's taken everything that he can steal?
I humbled myself to her beauty: "Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might've missed?
Am I ready?
Is the whole thing going backwards? Are they playing our song?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is what do you do about Willy Mays? Martin Luther King? Olatunji?
That too many people have died?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?
Am I mixed up too much? Am I mixed up too hard?
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Was it me that shot him down in the cantina?
Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
Tell me, are those rock-and-roll dreams in your eyes?
Yes, because something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Did I hear someone tell a lie?
How can you say he will haunt you?
How can I live for You?
Before he can hear people cry?
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Don't you understand it's not my problem?
Who are you that I should have to lie?
Across the swooping plain?
Why didn't you just leave me if you didn't want to stay?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Well, you wear it so pretty. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
What else can a poor boy do?
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
Delia, oh, Delia, how can it be?
No, I wasn't very cute to him, was I?
Before you call him a man?
Just what do you think you have to guard?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn't it?
Yes, but you know something's happening, it's just that you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, how could you refuse?
Oh, why must I fall into the sadness? Do I look like Charles Atlas?
After he took from you everything he could steal?
Can I come home with you?
Just like a rolling stone?
Why was it so hard for you, if you didn't wanna be with me, just to leave?
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see?
When the truth's in our hearts and we still don't believe?
To blur the focus of my mind and keep my isolated?
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
Was that the thunder that I heard?
What's anybody indebted to him for?
Can you get back in?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to my room?
Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Tomorrow night would you say those lovely things you said tonight?
After he's taken anything he can steal?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Why don't you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
Are you anybody someone prays for or cries?
Why run any longer when you're running in vain?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Please, Mrs. Henry, won't you take me to your dad?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
But something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
When he's standing in front of you?
But, what's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
Of everything you see?
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
She said, 'Hey, man, you crazy or something?
How many more without any reward?
Did you ever hear them church bells toll?
Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Across the swamp of time?
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
"If I had his money, I'd do things my way"?
Why did they have to come blow you away?
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kinda joke?
Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile with the Memphis blues again?
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
"Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
When you can't even sense has it got any insides?
Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn?
But am I still dreaming yet?
Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
With the drumsticks in his pants?
Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
Too many people have died?
Have they missed you?
Can't you hear that rooster crowing?
After he's taken everything he can steal?
Do you lay in your bed? Do you stare at the stars?
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
Why wait any longer for no need to complain?
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too, but what cares I for praise?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Who among them could think he could outguess you?
And you, just what do you do anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say?
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, "Now what have you done?
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
To show me I was blinded, to show me I was gone?
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with?
What makes the wind wanna blow tonight?
Remember in El Paso once you shot one?
"Oh, how can–how can you ask me again?
But something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Or has it died out and melted like the snow?
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
And the mercy that you showed to me – who ever would have guessed?
"What God has given to us no man can take away"?
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Don't the moon look good, mama, shining down through the trees?
Ever meet your accusers face-to-face in the rain?
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Is that a smile that I see on your face?
When I am in the darkness, why must you intrude?
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
To be hunted by the man who was your friend?
When He said, "Pick up your bed and walk!", why must you criticize?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
Why don't you just come out once and scream it?
When what's lost has been found, what's to come has already been?
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?
Is it something comes natural? Is it easy to say?
After he's taken everything he could steal?
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
I seen better times, but who has not?
Sara, Sara, whatever made you wanna change your mind?
Oh, where are you tonight?
Did they hear when He told Peter, "Peter, put up your sword"?
Yes, but something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
But don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me?
By golly, what more can I say?
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
Did you ever have a dream that you couldn't explain?
And how does it feel?
Before they're forever banned?
She say, "You can't repeat the past." I say, "You can't?
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?
Just what in the world has come over you?
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
Is it rolling, Bob?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
What's a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Yes, now you're positive something's happening and you wish you knew what it was, don't you, Mr. Jones?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
How you willingly surrender to me, but, darling, will it last?
And you ask why I don't live here! Honey, how come you don't move?
For all these earthly things?
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek?
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?
Did you respect me for what I did?
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
If it's not that, then what is it you're trying to conceal?
Before he can see the sky?
In the words that I'm writing, in this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinking?
What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, so why not you and me?
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
Well, look it here, buddy, you wanna be like me?
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
When did you leave heaven?
What was it you wanted? Could you say it again?
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?
Is there any truth in that, Señor?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
If I can't help falling in love with you?
Have you ever heard them church bells toll?
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?
When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Where did you lose your wings?
Trying to kill somebody or die trying?
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you?
How much do I know, to talk out of turn?
Can't you hear that motor turning?
One more time for a simple twist of fate?
How could they ever mistake you?
To love and follow His direction?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer "no"?
And when the whistle blows, I got to go – oh, mama, don't you know?
Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright?
Why'd you have to treat me so bad? Did it have to be that way?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes?
Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
When men will beg God to kill them and they won't be able to die?
Well, how often's a man dance to the beat of the palm?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
Cobwebs in your mind, dust upon your eyes?
Adjust to what? A dream that bust?
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
To get caught without a ticket and be discovered beneath a truck?
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
How many paths did they try and fail?
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, what are you trying to prove?
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
But still something's happening and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Can't you feel that sun a-shining?
Why would I want to take your life?
Is the scenery changing? Am I getting it wrong?
Well, we all got on, what do you think?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Are you the same person that was here before?
Is there somebody waiting? Was there a slip of the lip?
If there's anyone that knows, is there anyone that cares?
Why am I walking? Where am I running?
What's happening in there? What's going on in your show?
"What are those hills yonder, my love?
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
But does anyone hear the music they play?
How's everything in heaven?
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man's come?
And you know something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Poor boy, where you been?
Like a rolling stone?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Are you ready?
Ain't it hard to stumble and land in some funny lagoon?
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
All their earthly principles they're gonna have to abandon?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
What made them want to come and blow you away?
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at?
Should I hold you close or let you go by?
What can I give to You?
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
Oh, I figured I'd lost you anyway. Why go on? What's the use?
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
Now you stand here saying you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Whatever you wanted, what can it be?
Does anyone even try?
Well, the [incomprehensible] in my soul, why was it created?
Is your main friend someone who's an old, known acquaintance of ours?
Oh, what would I do if not for you?
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
This feeling that I
And because time was on his side and because I
'Cause time was on his side and because I
[incomprehensible]
She [incomprehensible]
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
You have to pay to get outta
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
I'll take all the smog in Ca-li-for-ni-a
It was put together down in Argentina
Well, the dog collar's from India
"I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
When questioned who had sent for him he answered with his thumb
And pensively stood by his tomb
Well, by this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Oh, when all of your advisers heave their plastic
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
When your [incomprehensible] all advisers heave their plastic
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
Its iron claws attached
While some, on principles baptized
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
And he just walked along alone with his guilt so well-concealed
Now, when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And into the path you are hurled
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
But all that suffering was not to be compared
Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
"It's all been designed," he said, "to make you lose your mind
What I got ain't painful, it's just bound to kill me dead
"Equality". I spoke the word
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
Now, you know, nothing was delivered
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
How many times can a man turn his head
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
All the sweethearts you can hold
The enemy is subtle: how be it we're deceived
Seen the arrow on the door-post saying this land is condemned
Then, onward in my journey, I come to understand
It's a restless, hungry feeling that don't mean no one no good
I's out there painting on the old woodshed
I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned
Now, whenever I get up and
Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
And you hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
And things would be different the next time we wed
Standing on the water, casting your bread
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
You used to be so amused
And those whom doom and death had spared
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
As he saw me leap a hot-dog stand and a chariot that stood
I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I've been had
Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
When all the clowns that you have commissioned
There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped
And like a fool I mixed 'em and it strangled up my mind
Sixteen years, sixteen banners united
With your holy medallion in your fingertips now that fold
Now, Jack, he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
Somebody seen him hanging around
And they laid him down in the jail-house ground
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
And your trouble is you know it too good
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
He was a clean-cut kid
Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
I thought that it was well-understood
Roving gambler, he was very bored
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Either from the mountains of Madrid
I run right home and I went to bed
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
I musta been mad, I never knew what I had
But hope's just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard
On the wheels of fire, but will offer no reward
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend your hand
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
Now, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
To see him obviously framed
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
Then came the warning that was before the flood
It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
Yes, and how many times must a man turn his head
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I'd been had
Now you don't act so––so proud
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
And that even the nobles get properly handled
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
"Well, I remember seeing some ad
So, when you see your neighbor carrying something, help him with his load
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
Everything stays down where it's wounded
Things would be different the next time we wed
Yonder down here in this lonely crowd
Nothing was delivered
It's something you did
But something has changed
'Cause somebody tells me that death's coming 'round
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
So I'll make my stand
I want you, baby, just to understand
Now, a very great man once said
We live in a political world
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
By no special friend
But now something has changed
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
Maybe I'd'a done some good in the world
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
He wagged his tail and shook his head
The changes I was going through can't even be used
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
In a soldier's stance I aimed my hand
I had to say something to strike him very weird
She let go of my hand
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
Many times I've often prayed
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
There ain't nothing in this world
I will not go down under the ground
In the fury of the moment I can see the master's hand
They took a clean-cut kid
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
Then time will tell just who has fell and who's been left behind
Now, the teen-preacher looked so baffled when I asked him why he dressed
"Oh, don't you see my own heart's blood
Just what you had in mind
Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
You used––be so proud
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
I'll always thank the Lord
I live in another world
Then time will tell who has fell and who's been left behind
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
Now you don't seem so proud
All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
I can't help it if you might think I am odd
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
For what you sold that's not been received
But it's trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head
Maybe someday you will understand
I've been walking around
I still can remember the way that you smiled
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
When all – all of the bandits you have commissioned
And then you told me later as I apologized
Please get outta the new one if you can't lend a hand
Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
You got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
Silvio, silver and gold
Drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
As I stand upon the sand
Mr. Empire sits up as high as a bird
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
But there's violence in the eyes, girl, so let us not be enticed
Who invited me to her house. I went, but she had a friend
But she ain't gonna find the road
So, the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted
He look so righteous while your face is so changed
You try so hard, but you don't understand
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
For you've only the lend of them as I suppose
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Taking care of somebody nice
Just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
Come gather 'round, friends, and I'll tell you a tale
Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Where I could watch her waltz for free
Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
To push fake morals, insult, and stare
The tall, dark man who rode by his side
To give the special one you seek a chance
Saying, "Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
I'm sure you're the one to blame
The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
One look at his face showed the hard road he'd come
And I'm just the same as anyone else
Just pick anyone
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
Don't hurt me none, it don't hurt my pride
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
From all the plans they do pursue
And you see why it's so unique to be
Throw my troubles out the door, I don't need them anymore
But I can get another one
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
She dropped a coin into the cup above a blind man at the gate
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
But I feel nothing for their game
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
He was well connected, but her heart was a snare
How many ears must one man have
And her silver-studded phantom cause
Why wait any longer for the one you love
First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
You just pick anyone
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
Leaving men wholly, totally free
As he rises to fame
I can survive and I can endure
I don't even notice she gone
Redeemed men who have escaped from the noose
When the roses fade
The city fathers, they're trying to endorse
You know, it's not even safe no more
She should've caught me in my prime, she would've stayed with me
Push fake morals, insult, and stare
At dawn my lover comes to me
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
You said you'd never compromise
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack machine
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
The pangs of your sadness will pass as your senses will rise
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, and I tried to make sense
Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
Puts his both hands in the pockets of chance
Then you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten till he's tame
Well, I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The gypsy's door was open wide, but the gypsy was gone
There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
There were times when I was so lonesome
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
From the crossroads of my doorsteps my eyes, they begin to fade
Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
She plunged him into well water where
I'm ready for to fade
And suddenly there appeared before me
And plenty time for good romance
The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
So I look like a walking mountain range
The man the authorities came to blame
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And he always is blessed with a charming, young wife
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
On the rising curve
A bed that is never mine
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene
You say you're looking for someone
And the names of the heroes I was made to memorize
Now, I got a friend who spends his life
"It's only you that he does crave
"Oh, daughter, oh, daughter, your body I will confine
But I can't think for you, you'll have to decide
For they're deep and they're wide and the world's on its side
And the boat drifts onto the shoreline
The crashing waves roll over me
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame
See the primitive wallflower freeze
The cause was there before we came
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
With all memory and fate
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
I was born and brought up there all the laws to abide
Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
So, I called up the operator of time
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Puts both of his hands in the pockets of chance
And the Negro's name
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
Better stay away from those
There's a neon light ablaze in a green, smoky haze
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
I am homeless, come and take me
I's taught and brought up there the laws to abide
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
I can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me
Found a note she'd left behind, but he could not concentrate
But it won't be over till they clear his name
Remember me to the one who lives there
Little did I realize
"That I might be gone a long, old time
Feel to moan, but unlike before
A girl who would murder her own, true love
Up into some paradise
Beauty walks on a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
Some pretty, little girl in Cornersville
So I remember every face
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Looking at hands for the lines that were
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
And that is that one must always flush out his house
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
If dogs run free, then what must be
And through the roar and smoke the string, it finally broke
"Oh, father, you will surely die
Limited in sex they dare
Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
And it ain't on that dim-lit stage
But I wouldn't feel too all alone
How was I to know you'd be the one
You smiling through the fence at me
I owe my heart to you and that's saying it true
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
You cut to the core
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
But I can't say I sympathize
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
If you're looking to get silly, you better go back to from where you came
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
You'll never know the hurt I suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
What good am I then to others and me
Lies that life is black-and-white
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
But I learned to accept it, accept it with pride
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
From the start by the rule
I don't know if I'm smart, but I think I can see
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
Just what you will say when you get home
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
What you're gonna say when you get home
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
You'll never know the hurt I've suffered, nor the pain I'd rise above
They say don't come back no more
Though its shadow's metal badge
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
Now, his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the cyanide hole
What about that millionaire
When Reilly's daughter got a message
And here I sit so patiently waiting to find out what price
It'll be with me unto the grave
And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize
So happy just to see you smile underneath the sky of blue
Suddenly I turned around, she was standing there
City fathers, they're trying to endorse
And I would send a message
All I feel is heat and flame
And I ain't complaining none
Waiting to find out what price
Then sends out for the doctor, who pulls down the shade
Should I leave them by your gate
When you're lagging behind and losing your pace
Hunger pays a heavy price
Full of hope and desire
She knows there's no success like failure
If dogs run free, why not we
And handed out strongly for penalty and repentance
I said, "Sometime, not all the time." Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
That she's the same one
King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Remember me to one who lives there
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Princess on the steeple and all pretty people
Frog went a-courting and a-he did ride
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
While them that defend what they cannot see
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
Should I put them by your gate
Knows there's no success like failure
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
From the Golden Gate Bridge
You could almost think that you're seeing double
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness, or your kind of love
When the rain is blowing in your face
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
Among the lovely people living free
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
I been wondering all about me
So happy just to be alive underneath the sky of blue
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
When I'm all alone
Mona tried to tell me
I rode with him in a taxi once
It's all new to me
When that steamboat whistle blows, I'm gonna give you all I got to give
"Well, are you weeping for your house and home
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
We see this empty cage now corrode
Says it's closing time
Maybe someday you will look back and see
"Well, I thought when I was there, Lord, what am I doing here
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
Rather be in some lonely hollow where the sun don't ever shine
I do declare
Everybody's wearing a disguise
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
If dogs run free, why not me
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
I was standing on the steps feeling most alone
But, when the shadowy sun sets on the one
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
He tried his best to talk, but his mouth could hardly move
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
You're not free to belong to me
Till one morning's wake the bed, it was bare
So up she picked her babies three
She been gone
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
Most of the time I can't even be sure
Con you into thinking that you're the one
He'll see by his grave
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
You into thinking you're the one
Yep, she promised that she'd be right there with me
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
And never sat once at the head of the table
From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes start to fade
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
Well, it's all new to me
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel too all alone
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
But the dark does die
And a longtime, golden-haired stripper onstage
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
What's probably got you baffled more
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how oftentimes I repine
But, as he turned to leave, he called his mother close
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
You should be made to be wearing a telephone
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view the fair fields all alone
In the days of old, in the days of gold, how ofttimes I repine
To show you something you seen before
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Graveyards and false goals, I scuff
Everybody sees hisself
Trust yourself
When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she was deaf
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
Oh, trust yourself
There's nothing in here moving
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight till he came to a river raging
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
If I was with her too long
Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
It's not a bad way to make a living
You say to yourself, "Just what am I doing
I know that you know that I know that you show something
May you build a ladder to the stars and climb on every rung
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
She said, "I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
Oh, the lines are long and the fighting is strong
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
The battle outside raging
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
The order is a-rapidly fading
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
Early in the morning, early in the morning
A-there's a-nothing in here that's a-moving
I can hear their hearts a-beating
For your weary toes to be a-touching
They're drinking up and walking
What am I saying? What am I knowing
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
You left me standing in the doorway crying
And there's no telling a-who that it's naming
I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
And the seagulls, they'll be smiling
The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And the cards are no good that you're holding
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Beyond here lies nothing
She rode by night and came by morning
And you can't–you remember for the best of your thinking
And the seagulls, they'll be a-smiling
Well, the moral of the story, the moral of this song
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
I've escaped death so many times I know I'm only living
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Oh, the gentlemen are talking
The order is rapidly fading
And the shoreline sands will be shaking
'Cause the battle outside raging
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
And the sounds of the night, they made my ears ring
Oh, your love comes on so strong and I've waited all day long
She wakes him up forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
The drag lines and the shovels, they was humming
And swear-words and sneering and his tongue, it was snarling
I'd forever talk to you, but soon my words, they would turn into a meaningless ring
And I'll know the wind blows snowing
But the soldiers on our convict ship were full five hundred strong
As I look around this world, all that I'm finding
But then a whistle will be blowing
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Deceived me into thinking
Well, I set my monkey on the log
'Cause sometimes you hear 'em when the night times come creeping
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
By this time I'd'a thought that I would be sleeping
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Where the time and the tempo drag
When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
May your heart always be joyful and may your song always be sung
For your weary toes to be touching
For one thing for certain, you will surely be a-hurting
I have fallen far beneath
When you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush
Can they imagine the darkness that will fall from on high
Oh, the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
Look out, the saints are coming through
And you figured you failed in yesterday's rush
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And how I know I'll make it through
I'm singing you the song, but I can't sing enough
Then she told us how times were tough
You go north and you go south
Girls' faces formed the forward path
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
Oh, these costly beads around my neck
Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Shoot in the back
Disillusioned words like a-bullets bark
You fight for the throne and you travel alone, unknown as you slowly sink
I wish she'd unlock
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
You turn around to take a final peek
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
Till a man come to speak and he said in one week
The man in me will do nearly any task
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
Her voice once and talk
You glance through the mirror and there's eyes staring clear at the back of your head as you drink
In the wee hours of youth, my mother took sick
Then the Greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck
There's a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
Now, the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
Well, there ain't no going back
Make everything from toy guns that spark
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss in the valley of a missing link
Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws and the sound of the keys as they clink
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
And me, I nearly got busted – and wouldn't it be my luck
"And I could not help but think through the thunder-rolling stink
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
But the magician is quicker and his game is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you like the plague with a dangerous wink
You know you can't keep her and the water gets deeper that is leading you onto the brink
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy, but I went into a bank
But they caught him and they brought him back
I traveled through East Texas where many martyrs fell
How many seas must a white dove sail
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell
William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
Soul to soul our shadows roll
And if my love is real
How many seas must the white dove sail
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control
I'll go to some hollow and sit at my still
A-how does it feel
As his fist, it hit the icebox, he said he's gonna kill
How does it feel
Ring bar, hard to tell
Ring bell, hard to tell
Muttering small talk at the wall
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
Come 'round, you roving gamblers, and a story I will tell
A girl by the whirlpool
Oh, how does it feel
To make all that should be killed to crawl
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps for the soul
I chased me a woman up the hill
Gather 'round, you people, and a story I will tell
"Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
In the courtroom of honor the judge pounded his gavel
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
Then why don't she tell
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
About a brave, young Indian you should remember well
Now, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
He's taught in his school
You find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
Beneath his boundaries – what more if I can tell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Well, I don't figure I'll be back there for a spell
I'm gazing out the window of the St. James Hotel
But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
There soon came a horrible, dying yell
Let every state in this union seep deep down in your soul
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
They ask me how I feel
But among the dead that were left on the hill
He's sure got a lot of gall
But me, I expected it to happen, I knew he'd lost control
Well, if I die on top of the hill
Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
And, sure as hell, you're bound to tell
We had a falling-out like lovers often will
National Bank is selling road-maps to the soul
And the National Bank at a profit sells road-maps to the soul
All and all can only fall
Yeah, but, if I die on top of the hill
Therefore, I remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
With rich, wealthy parents who provide and protect him
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And remain as I am
See for me if she's wearing her coat so warm
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
"For you cannot relive them
You'll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
Two eyes took the aim
But, with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
The gray-flannel dwarf to scream
Mr. Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
But I can hear another drum
Now, they asked me to read a poem
Well, the chance is against it and the odds are slim
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
So, one morning when the sun was warm
You better not chew gum
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
There's a white-diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down that hill again
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
I've heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
There was little to say, there was no conversation
Well, looking for a woman that ain't got no man
To my knowledge there's just one man
A-she takes just like a woman
Somebody new to beat on
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
Temptation's not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
You don't need a weatherman
My heart's in the Highlands at the break of dawn
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down, feeling low and mean
The next morning she had awoken
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
For the loser now will be later to win
In the pigpen
Two-wheeled, gypsy queen
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
All lay down their bandanas and complain
Oh, how can I explain? It's so hard to get on
Try to steal back your numbness, all your pain
There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
Uncle Rat went running downtown
Nothing we can call our own
But me, I expected it to happen
I'll follow your casket on the pale afternoon
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
I'll be waiting at the station
But the second mother was with the seventh son
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring, bad design
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
And she aches just like a woman
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
Darkness at the break of noon
And I gaze back to the street, the sidewalk, and the sign
They bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
Come to the door, he couldn't get in
And there's no exit in any direction
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
Out of the shower comes a football man
Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
You didn't trust me for a minute, babe, I've never known the spring to turn
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
But all their daughters put me down
My love, she's like some raven
But it's hard to think on
Yes, and someone must explain
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Must meet the dawn
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
"Not me," said the gambling man
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
The number one contender for the middleweight crown
He just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
She said that all the railroad men
But Eden is burning: either get ready for elimination
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun
In the empty lot where the ladies play blindman's bluff with the key-chain
In ceremonies of the horsemen
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Well, you fake just like a woman
Are they lost or are they found? Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
But the second mom was with the seventh son
Have beat out your destruction or your pain
For the loser now might be later to win
Their religion of the little ten women
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
From the fool's gold mouthpiece, the hollow horn
And she wakes just like a woman
Why did you trade heaven
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
And some dark night when everything is silent in the town
From heights that they could not gain
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
To remember the times when I was your only man
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
I wish–I wish–I wish in vain
She picked him up all in her arms and carried him to town
I wish I could write you a melody so plain
And you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
He got that fortress on the mountain
Well, I'm hanging on
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
She takes just like a woman
Don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
She'll be standing on the bar soon with a fish-head and a harpoon
All their daughters put me down
Poor boy in a red-hot town
His clothes are dirty, but his––his hands are clean
And all their daughters put me down
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And the corner sign
I am hanging in the balance of a perfect, finished plan
I don't even care if I ever see her again
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
You need something to make it known
As you sit on the box you keep him in
Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
The ones that jump on the wagon
She got such a sweet disposition
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Well, I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
But I swear I see my reflection
Plays wasted words, it proves to warn
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
And you ache a-just like a woman
Where the home in the valley meets the damp, dirty prison
I figure maybe we're even
Suicide remarks are torn
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Sold my guitar to the baker's son
Trying to get a lead on
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain
The foreign sun, it squints upon
Stop this weeping, this useless pain
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Have died in battle or in vain
Guns and clubs followed him down
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Billy, don't it make you feel so low-down
How many roads must a man walk down
Advertising signs that con
If the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on
But the post office has been stolen
Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
That long, black train is pulling on down
As they rode him in custody down to the station
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
That long, black train is pulling down
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
You take just like a woman
Please don't let on that you knew me when
Have died – have died in battle or in vain
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
How can the life of such a man
Ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
Well, when all your – all the bandits that you turn your other cheek to
And the riot squad, they're restless, they need somewhere to go
All I really wanna do
All I'd like you to do
And a man's gonna do what he has to do
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter-time too
Now, when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
You would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go
It's very nice to stay a week or two
Oh, baby, but that god that you been praying to
There's nothing you can say or do
There is a place you go
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go
Well, it's by and by I'll slip my chains, into the bush I'll go
Now, there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
Silvio, I gotta go
Every place I wanna go
Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
The very last thing that I'd want to do
And ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from my broken cup
The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Now, the beach is deserted except for some kelp
The man in the coon-skin cap
Aladdin and his lamp
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee with a soulful, bounding leap
Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you find out when you reach the top
Make your money while you can before you have to stop
How many times must a man look up
Man in the coon-skin cap
What good am I while you softly weep
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
Oh, the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep
I walked down there and ended up
Wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Now, for recreation we went on a tramp
All you boys better run for cover
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
For all eternity I think I will remember
In one I was running and in another
The lover who has just walked out your door
At any moment you could go under
Well, my Ruthie said come see her
"Young man, I will tell you a secret: it's true I'm a maid that is poor
I close my eyes and I wonder
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
But, if you think I'll let Barry Goldwater
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I don't even think about her
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the war
"Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
You heard me saying a prayer for
I could feel a whole lot better
Like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
Were we slandered, babe? Did we follow a star
She took him by his long, yellow hair
As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
I don't have to go far
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
"Go tell my companion and children most dear
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
The face of God will appear
"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
You need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler
"Peace will come with tranquility and the splendor
The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When you whispered in my ear
When only you are near
I say, "Why you say that for
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's tower
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear
With a cane that he twirled 'round his diamond ring finger
So sleep with one eye open when you wonder
Still I say her love-words over
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
Never no more do I wonder
Seem like every time you turn around there's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but in the final shot he'd won the war
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
Then you set back and watch when the death-count gets higher
Still I've always kind of missed her
When the weak and the strong and the rich and the poor
Well, the streets––the face of God will soon appear
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
So, don't fear if you hear
Who came here from Cuba's door
But morning is clear
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
The wind howls like a hammer
You'd never know it to look at him, but in the final shot he won the war
My ship is in the harbor
Romantic facts of musketeers
On the back of the fish truck that loads
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
So, when Frankie Lee needed money one day, Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
As friends and other strangers
Fortune calls, I step forth from the shadows
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
And tells me of her dreams
In the dime-stores and bus-stations
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels
And some of us'll stand to meet you on your crossroads
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
And inside it with the people made of molasses
And so Patty calls the cops
But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
He's not selling any alibis
"I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
Well, you never turned around to see the frowns
You can fall down on your knees
We living in times when men commit crimes
To memorizing politics
I was thinking of a series of dreams
That it's you and no one else that owns
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
With a fantastic collection of stamps
They whisper in the wings
Bald wig for Jack the Ripper, who sits
You know that he has no intentions
Now, all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Good and bad, I define these terms
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
To sharpen the senses
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
But, though the masters make the rules
In the dimestores and bus-stations
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
At times I think there are no words
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
And without further notice he tells you how it feels
Seven days
To the cutting of fences
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
People on the platforms
And ain't in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate-cake voices
Six-time losers
The night aimed shadows through the crossbar windows
What good am I if I say foolish things
People carry roses
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
Cinderella, she seems so easy. "It takes one to know one," she smiles
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
And your father, to your sister he explains
The empty-handed painter from your streets
You stare into the vacuum of his eyes
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts
I struggled to my feet, I rode past destruction in the ditches
You never turned around to see the frowns
Her window's wide open, African trees
Down over the window come the dazzling, sunlit rays
Six-time users
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley with his pointed shoes and his bells
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
I'd gladly confess
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
How many deaths will it take till he knows
Don't follow leaders
And without further notice asks you how it feels
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
While Calypso-singers laugh at them and fishermen hold flowers
Sits with Utopian hermit-monks
Now, you must provide some answers
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
I'm gonna let you pass
Wants eleven dollar bills
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
Don't wear sandals
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
Ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
In the wild, cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
"Not me," said the man whose fists
And I try to harmonize with songs
Plowed furrows of death through the toiling ranks
You been hurt so many times
I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
The cowboy angel rides
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
Well, the ragman draws circles
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
But still remains
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
I try to tell it like it is
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies
When your mother sends back all your invitations
Oh, the tree of life is growing where the spirit never dies
There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
As the rain rattled heavy on the bunk-house shingles
And then complains
For the flowers of the city, though breath-like, get death-like sometimes
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
You should be made to wear earphones
Thinking of a series of dreams
Thought I'd seen some ups and downs
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
I decided to flip a coin, like either heads or tails
To Jezebel, the nun, she violently knits
And the princess and the prince discuss
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
You have many contacts all among the lumberjacks
And every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Rolling, high-and-mighty traps
The ghost of Belle Starr, she hands down her wits
Upon four-legged forest-clouds
Nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
Well, the ghost of Belle Starr, she hand down her wits
Uncle Rat laughed and he shook his fat sides
You put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes
Drinking man listen to the voice he hears
True love can make a blade of grass
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
Well, now, time passed and now it seems
We scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
And, though the masters make the rules
I let it slip gladly to my friends
So I forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs
And the poor white remains
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
With a big bouquet of the roses
Statues made of matchsticks
Renegade priests and treacherous, young witches
Glide across the lonely years
Mama, you know, awaits the news
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
My last deal gone down, she's smelling sweet like the meadows
And neither will take it from snappy, young brats
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And your sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
Girl by the whirlpool's
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
He built a fire on Main Street
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
You used to laugh–make fun about
Yes, nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect
Yet you know there is a-no answer fit
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I'll make it
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
Johnny's in the basement
Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
We can hold up a toast if we meet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Oh, the leaves began to falling and the seas began to part
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Everyone still talks about
For sixteen nights and days he raved, but on the seventeenth he burst
Talking that the heat put
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
'Twas then she felt alone and wished that she'd gone straight
We all sit here stranded though we're all doing our best to deny it
Keep it in your mind and not forget
Yet you know there is no answer fit
There's some people that
Yet you know that there is no answer fit
So he never thinks straight
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
I soon get some rest
Well, I couldn't leave unless the old man chased me out
You say, "How are you?", "Good luck", but you don't mean it
And I'm left alone in my misery like some old, poor, wandering ghost
Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
With your pockets well protected at last
Without any doubt
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
She seems too far out
And you think your ears mighta been hurt
Someday, everything is gonna be different
You're hearing my heart beat
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into leaving his post
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
Well, I finally started thinking straight
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Oh, the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
God said, "You can do what you want, Abe, but
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
Wait for the morning light
He really wasn't where it's at
To keep it in your mind and not forget
You are there in the flickering light
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
But, if the arrow is straight
By the way, that's a cute hat
Oh, everybody's got to eat
To hold each other tight
Then the shaft was soon shut and more work was cut
And the first one now will later be last
I'm closing the book on the pages and the text
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short
The slowest now will later be fast
How many years can a mountain exist
But, then again, there's only one I've met
Everything is always right
And I, in my armor, turning about
You used to laugh about
"Well, if I had the stars of the darkest night
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
No one has any respect, anyway they expect
Ain't it hard when you discover that
They tell me to be discreet
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And I said, "Oh, I didn't know that, but then again there's only one I've met
The slow one now will later be fast
Plants in the bed, but
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Keep it in your mind and don't forget
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
Keep me set apart
And, since my feet are now fast
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
But, I mean no harm nor put fault
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
"Oh, no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
And he carries a reminder of every blow that's laid him low and cut him till he cried out
I think that it's best
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And soon the situation there was all but straightened out
If there's a poor boy on the street, then let him have my seat
One more night I will wait for the light
We sit here stranded though we all do our best to deny it
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
Fifth daughter on the twelfth night
And no one has any respect, anyway they just expect
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
I got into the driver's seat
Every new messenger bringing evil report
You were so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
Well, early in the morning till late at night
One more night the moon is shining bright
Now, all the authorities, they just stand around and boast
I'm moving after midnight
Our Father would not like the way that you act
In the stillness of the midnight
Maybe he'll see her once again – how long must he wait
A-ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
How many years can some people exist
You don't forget
They tell me revenge is sweet
She felt the heat of the night hit her like a freight
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split
Like a corkscrew to my heart
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms into getting up and leaving his post
It don't take too long to find out
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
In the precious winds they rot
Maybe she'll pick him out again – how long must he wait
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
You're gonna get hit
That might be all that you got
I'm on the pavement
There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
I just might have to come see you
I'll remember you
It's just crazy being here with you
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
I can be just like you
To protect you and defend you
And I tell this truth to you
To be alone with you
Now, when all of the flower-ladies want back what they have lent you
Well, I'd sure like to know
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
And the Phantom shouts to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
He been living there three years now
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel and the plow
But sooner or later one of us must know
I knew I had to split, but I did not know how
And the Phantom is shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow
Down every street there's a window
As he turned away to go, his mother was acting slow
At midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
They all play on the penny whistle, you can hear them blow
I seen a lot of women, but she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Don't it always a-go to show
Now, at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get outta here if you don't know
It only goes to show
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
With only you in view
The only one I know
Yes, I'd sure like to know
I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
He whispered kind of slow in a voice she didn't know
Now, you're probably wondering by now
And the little, wee drummer, we flattened his bow
Sooner or later one of us must know
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
Don't it always go to show
He seen a lotta women, but she never escaped his mind and he just grew
All along the watchtower princes kept the view
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
I'd sure like to know
We banged the drum slowly
"Oh, help me in my weakness," I heard the drifter say
For them that think death's honesty
Then the Civil War too was soon laid away
A cock is crowing far away
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
If I don't take the chance to try
Don't you tell Henry
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
Someone to get you flowers constantly
Or if you just want some company
So, I'm walking down your highway
He made the bells of freedom ring today
Maggie says that many say
But I wish there was something you would do or say
She knocked upon it anyway
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
That I was just a puppet in a play
So I cut off a-my hair and I rode straight away
And that which you've given me today
I laid on the dune, I looked at the sky
Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
So I run down most hurriedly
Upon the beach, where hound dogs bay
The same thing I would want today
For them that think death––death's honesty
My mind weaves a symphony
She smiles, walks the other way
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Yes, call him "Drunken" Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
My ears hear a symphony
No, you'll not now or no other day
Yes, I'm walking down your highway
Haul on the bowline." We sang that melody
Went to the doctor the very next day
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
When I left my home and family, I was no more than a boy
How many times must the cannon balls fly
And I'm leaving every day to run away
I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
"It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for pay
I send you all my money
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
Oh, his face was all shot off and his hands were blown away
Yes, I'm walking down the highway
The Spanish-American War had its day
"There are no mistakes in life," some people say
I will turn my head up high to that dark and rolling sky
There's a brand-new gimmick every day
She starts to speak, but he walks away
Spouted out that liberty
But you can never steal away
Someday everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
To those condemned to act accordingly
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
But I can't deny
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
Well, I'm walking down the highway
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
She puts it to me plain as day
And the Civil War too was soon laid away
That I done it the way
He's wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Is worth more than I could pay
There's a pale, drooping maiden who toils her life away
Well, I saw it advertised one day
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
And for His love they took His life away
For them that must obey authority
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
Though I'd never say
So they took him to the infirmary
And the only tune my guitar could play
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
And it's up to you to say
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
And the ladies treat me kindly
Rita looked offended, but she got out of the way
I did not do it harmfully
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
Shakespeare, he's in the alley
From phony jealousy
And, dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49 –
In a game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of '49 –
Explaining to the judge I'd be there on Wednesday night –
"That a friend of mine would get ninety-nine years?" –
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa" –
If only could hang on and just be her friend –
Yes, I know, from darkness dreams are deserted –
Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast –
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Can't stand the suspense anymore––
Fools glorify themselves trying to manipulate Satan –
You say my kisses aren't like his –
Turn, turn, turn again –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded without love –
Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called "Gunga Din" –
That's a-hanging in the Louvre –
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
Whispering your secret emotion –
What happened to him could happen to anyone –
About having to be scrounging for your next meal –
Oh, lose your inhibition [incomprehensible] –
I can't believe it! I can't believe I'm alive, but without you it doesn't seem right––
Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Eclipses both the sun and moon –
With notions his canoe was laden –
If I only could a-hang on and just be her friend –
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
Like good, old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49 –
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow––
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape––well, I won't, but then maybe again I might––
A crash on the highway flew the car to a field –
I played my guitar through the night to the day –
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift, gate won't close, railings froze –
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Oh, Lucky's driving a long, long time –
The judge spoke out of the side of his mouth –
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer, sure" -- in the days of '49 –
I ask you how things could get much worse –
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em –
Drive you from your fear, bring you through the mirror –
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Saying, "Could you kindly leave my office now, please?" –
Though its glow is waxed in black –
We just wanted to see some sweat –
I hope that you can hear––
He saw him disappear by a tree near a lake –
Oh, God, 'cause when – Amsterdam and Paris –
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
How badly they were shocked –
When you ain't got nothing, girl, you got nothing to lose –
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved –
Into the vacuum of his eyes––
Saying one of your friends is in trouble deep –
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore," in the days of '49 –
Hava–na–
Without a reply I left by the moon –
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells –
But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
He looks so truthful – is this how he feels? –
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece –
That may be true, he's got a sentence to serve –
I'm looking good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun –
Well, ask me why I'm drunk all the time –
Sometimes it gets so hard to care –
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed –
I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed –
I a-hope you can hear––
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
Private reasons – great or small –
Indians camp along her border –
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
We stared into each other's eyes till one of us would break –
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
Oh, what is the charge of how this came to be? –
See for me if her hair is hanging long –
The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
Well, the pressure's down, the boss ain't here –
She was born in spring, but I was born too late –
Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
From now on you'd best get on someone else –
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page of a book that nobody can write––
The room was funny and I stood up so slow –
Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
At that the judge jerked forward and his face, it did freeze –
And many a road taken by many a first friend –
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you –
I'll be in Santa Fe about one –
"Could you tell me the facts," I said without fear –
I walked down the hallway and I heard his door slam –
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
But he ain't no criminal and his crime, it is none –
Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Hang out the whole next day –
You'd come back and you'd stay –
But they got a lot of forks and knives –
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
Disconnect these cables––
I lived by the window as he talked to himself –
Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Judge had the papers in his hand –
She inherited a million bucks and, when she died, it came to me –
There was four persons killed and he was at the wheel –
Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
I return to the Chinese flute – touching me, it wasn't cute –
To know where you are –
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets –
I'll stand in awe and I'll shake my face –
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal –
Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
No one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest –
He said-a, "All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth" –
[incomprehensible] in the grave – in American future –
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
Havana–gee–
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Someone who will die for you and maybe more –
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Ten thousand miles or more –
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust –
They crammed me back into the county jail –
With the mystery tramp, but now––but––his eye––
As suicide remarks are torn –
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years –
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark –
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
I long to hold you in the night –
You're the sweetest, gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get –
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, looking so good –
You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months –
He was raving about how he loved my sound –
I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
One of these days – and it won't be long –
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Remember me to one who lives there –
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you –
If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived––
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed –
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting –
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley –
I knew a man, Bojangles, and he'd dance for you in worn-out shoes –
But ninety-nine years he just don't deserve –
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
And, when it's over, just as soon go on my way"––
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
And there's really nothing anyone can say –
But it sure – my loved ones turning into puppets –
About having to be a-scrounging around, scrounging around for your next meal –
Every empire that's enslaved him is gone –
I walked down the courthouse stairs and I did not understand –
It can't be this way everywhere –
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose –
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion –
Ooh, mama, can this really be the end –
Driven mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
I got no idea what I want –
I sat down and wrote the best words I could write –
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ear –
Saying, "The witness who saw, he left little doubt" –
Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
For seven long years I courted Sally –
And old men with broken teeth, stranded, without love –
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else –
All that foreign oil controlling American soil –
Oh, my–
Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home –
Haven't seen her since that night –
Manslaughter in the highest of degrees –
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of '49 –
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat –
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad –
But I get no offers, just a come-on from the whores on 7<sup>th</sup> avenue –
Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
We'll fly it over the ocean just like you suspect –
Leave all the children home –
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Now, I've had enough, my box is clean –
And your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet –
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Oh, mama, can this really be the end –
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
And was in his chambers by the next afternoon –
I've just reached a place where the willow don't bend –
Too late, too late, for his case, it is sealed –
So, hang on to your woman if you've got one –
Yes, and only if she was lying by me –
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam into Paris –
But I know him as good as I'm knowing myself –
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Somebody could freeze right to the bone –
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
You will not hear a laugh –
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
The sentence is passed and it cannot be repealed –
I'm sure it was not three –
Ha–va–
Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection –
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
I was three-fourths drunk, she looked alright –
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
And I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
Joliet prison and ninety-nine years –
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
But he was just a Pima Indian – no money, no crops, no chance –
With no other choice except but for to go –
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land––
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Havanagee–luh–
The race of the engine that overrules your heart –
I was in your presence for an hour or so –
Bad news, bad news came to me where I sleep –
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve –
First degree and second degree –
All that foreign oil – American soil –
Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against –
I got knocked down and my head was swimming –
You do what you must do and you do it well –
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used –
They walked along by the old canal, a little confused – I remember well –
That can win what's a-never been won –
Now your mouth cries wolf while your––
I didn't know that you'd be leaving –
Yes, you do, you know you do…
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it…
Trouble…
